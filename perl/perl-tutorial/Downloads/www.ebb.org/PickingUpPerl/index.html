<CITE>Picking Up Perl, Edition 0.12</CITE>, A Freely Redistributable Perl Tutorial Book
</H1>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>

This site was created as an early distribution center for <CITE>Picking Up
Perl</CITE>.  <CITE>Picking Up Perl</CITE> is a freely redistributable
tutorial book on Perl.

<P>

Currently, <A HREF="http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn">Bradley M. Kuhn</A> is the
primary author of the work.  However, some others have contributed small
patches, and lots of others have provided useful constructive criticism.

<P>

Currently, edition 0.12 of the book is available.  Note that this book is
still under development.  Errors are likely, so read carefully.

<P>

Due to his current demanding job, bkuhn hasn't had time to work on the
book in over a year.  He hopes to get started again eventually, and has
started a (currently empty) <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/pup/">savannah project for PUP</a>.

<P>

<P>
<H2>Announcements</H2>

<!--  subscribe to the announcement mailing list. -->
<!--  <P> -->

<!--  To subscribe to this list, send a message with the body or subject -->
<!--  "subscribe" to the address <A -->

<P>
<H2>Feedback</H2>

Feedback to this work is welcome and encouraged.  You can give feedback via
email.  Please send it to <A
HREF="mailto:pup-comments@ebb.org">pup-comments@ebb.org</A>.  If you have
specific changes that fix code example bugs, typos or other small problems
of that ilk, it would be appreciated if you would <A HREF="index.html#Patch">submit a
patch to the Texinfo source</A> rather than just an email.  However, if you
are confused by the patch instructions, an email is fine.

<P>

To give feedback without a patch, please do the following:

<UL>

<LI>For each suggestion, give two lines of context, and the
<STRONG>name</STRONG> of the chapter or section where the lines
occur. (Section numbers aren't helpful, as they are automatically
generated.)

<LI>Quote those two lines of context, then write what you suggest below it.
Clearly mark both as to what they are, so it is clear which is the existing
text and which is the change.

</UL>
