<H2>5.1  The A* algorithm in Prolog </H2>
<P>
Section <A HREF="2_16.html">2.16</A> introduced an outline for a simple 
Prolog search program.  This section discusses heuristic search using the 
A* algorithm, due to Nilsson (1980).
<P>
<EM>Heuristic search</EM> uses a <EM>heuristic function</EM> to help guide the 
search.  When a node is expanded, each of its children is evaluated using 
a <EM>search function</EM>.  Each child is placed into a list of nodes -- the so-called 
<EM>open list</EM> -- in order 
determined by the search function evaluation (smaller values first).  The heuristic function 
estimates <EM>how much work must be done to reach a goal from 
the node in question</EM>.  Typically, the search function f is expressed
 as<CENTER>
f(n) = g(n) + h(n) <BR>
</CENTER>
where g(n) represents the (computed, actual) cost of getting to the node n along the current 
path to it, and h is the heuristic function.  Thus, f(n) estimates the cost or 
effort to successfully get from start to goal by going through node n (along 
some particular particular path).
<P>

Here is some simple pseudocode from which the Prolog program will be 
developed. <BR>
<OL>
<LI>Start with the start node, place it in the (previously empty) list <STRONG>open</STRONG>.
<LI>Let n be the first node on <STRONG>open</STRONG>.  Remove n from <STRONG>open</STRONG>. 
   Fail if <STRONG>open</STRONG> is empty. 
<LI>If n is the goal, then a solution has been found.  (One could stop here.) <BR>
<LI>Expand n, obtaining all of its children, and evaluate f(-) for each of them.
   Insert each of these children into <STRONG>open</STRONG>, maintaining order where the 
   smallest f(-) values come first. 
<LI>Repeat from step 2. 
</OL>
<P>
When a goal has been reached, one would certainly like to be able to return the 
solution path from the start to the goal.  The pseudocode ignored this 
feature, but it will be included as the Prolog prototype program is developed.
<P>
A common cost function g(-) is <EM>path length</EM>.  The cost of getting from the 
start node to a current node is the length of relevant path.  This can be 
computed incrementally, as will be seen.
<P>
It is important to realize that this kind of search can follow a contiguous 
path for a while, until some previously unchosen node n has the current smallest 
f(-) value, in which case this node n is expanded, and its children considered. 
<P>
Now for the Prolog program for the A* search.
<P>
Let us assume that <STRONG>State</STRONG> refers 
to some description of the state of a search.  For example <STRONG>State</STRONG> might 
be a description of the 8-puzzle tile for a specific configuration, as 
developed in the next section.  A <STRONG>Node</STRONG> in the search space (or graph) needs 
to record the <STRONG>State</STRONG>, the <STRONG>Depth</STRONG> (or path length from the start), the 
value of f(-) for the node <STRONG>F</STRONG>, and a list of the ancestors 
<STRONG>A</STRONG> of this node.  We will use the Prolog term structure
<P>
<CENTER>
<STRONG>Node = State#Depth#F#A</STRONG> <BR>
</CENTER> 
for a node.  When <STRONG>Node</STRONG> is expanded to find its children...
<UL>
<LI> The state of each child will be computed as a move from <STRONG>State</STRONG>
<LI> each of these children will have depth <STRONG>Depth</STRONG> + 1,
<LI> the f(-) value of each child will be calculated, and 
<LI> the ancestor list of a child will be the Prolog list term [<STRONG>Node</STRONG>|<STRONG>A</STRONG>].
</UL>
<P>
In general, if the <STRONG>Depth</STRONG> is replace by some other cost, the node 
representation would be similar; just replace <STRONG>Depth</STRONG> by a cost, and 
compute it appropriately.  Also, we will see in the next section (8-puzzle) 
that the ancestor list might be more conveniently saved as a list of 
symbolic actions (used to achieve successive states), rather that as 
a list of the actual full nodes themselves.  Other modifications of the prototypical 
A* algorithm presented in this section might be made, depending on the 
application.  
<P>
The main predicate for the program is
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
solve(Start,Soln) :- f_function(Start,0,F),
                     search([Start#0#F#[]],S),
                     reverse(S,Soln).

f_function(State,D,F) :- h_function(State,H),
                         F is D + H.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The 'Start' variable refers to the starting state description.  The first 
parameter for the search 
predicate represents the <STRONG>open</STRONG> list.  The 'h_function' 
definition needs to be supplied with the particular application.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
search([State#_#_#Soln | _], Soln) :- goal(State).
search([B|R],S) :- expand(B, Children),
                   insert_all(Children, R, NewOpen),
                   search(NewOpen,S).
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The version of the 'expand' predicate given here simply uses Prolog's 
bagof computation (thus bundling up a lot of work).
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
expand(State#D#_#A, All_My_Children) :-
         bagof(Child#D1#F#[Move|A],
               ( D1 is D + 1,
                 move(State,Child,Move),
                 f_function(Child,D1,F) ) ,
               All_My_Children).  

</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The (application dependent) 'move' predicate should generate the 'Child' states, in such a way as to 
obtain them all by backtracking.  (See the 8-puzzle example in the next section.)  As previously 
stated, the 'Move' can either be the the whole 
parent node itself or some appropriate substitute. (Actually, one should rewrite the 'expand' clause if 
one is going to use the whole node, rather some symbolic representation, as we do in 
the next section.)
<P>
Here is the code for insert_all.  It is a familiar kind of insertion-sort 
algorithm ...
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
insert_all([F|R],Open1,Open3) :- insert(F,Open1,Open2),
                                 insert_all(R,Open2,Open3).
insert_all([],Open,Open).

insert(B,Open,Open) :- repeat_node(B,Open), ! .
insert(B,[C|R],[B,C|R]) :- cheaper(B,C), ! .
insert(B,[B1|R],[B1|S]) :- insert(B,R,S), !.
insert(B,[],[B]).

repeat_node(P#_#_#_, [P#_#_#_|_]).

cheaper( _#_#H1#_ , _#_#H2#_ ) :- H1 &lt  H2.
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The following exercises ask the reader to formulate A* solutions to 
various problems or puzzles.  See the next section, 5.2 on the 8-puzzle, 
as an example of how to extend the general A* program of this section to 
a specific solution of the 8-puzzle.
<P>
<EM>Exercise 5.1.1</EM>  Formulate an A* algorithm for the N queens 
puzzle.   (See section 2.11 for a simple, but inefficient, approach.)
<P>
<EM>Exercise 5.1.2</EM>  Formulate an A* approach to maze solving.
