Frequently Asked Questions from Wed. (1/12/99 lab session)

1. How do I open a file in Perl?

 open (CALENDAR, $filename) or die "$0: could not open $filename: $!\n";

2. How do I get arguments that are passed to the script?

 if (@ARGV) {                      # Are there any arguments at all?
    $calendar_file = shift @ARGV;  # shift removes, returns the first element
 } else {                          # if there are no arguments,
    $calendar_file = 'calendar';   # use a file called calendar
 } 

An equivalent way to write all this is:

 $calendar_file = shift @ARGV || 'calendar';

3. How do I use Perl's hash tables?

 my %calendar;  # not strictly necessary, but used to declare a variable

 $calendar{'1991-01-01'} = 'Happy new year!';
 $calendar{'1991-01-02'} = 'Bad Hangover';

 print $calendar{'1991-01-01'}; # prints out "happy new year"
   
 $calendar{'1991-01-01') = "anything you want"; 

 print $calendar{'1991-01-01'}; # prints out "anything you want"  

 if (exists($calendar{'1991-01-02'}) {  # check the existence of a certain key 
    # do something
 }

 foreach my $key (keys %calendar) {
    # loops through all the keys of the hash table in *RANDOM* order
    # sets $key to a key, then goes through the loop, then goes to next key
    # and repeats the loop, until there are no more keys
 }

 foreach my $key (sort keys %calendar) {
    # loops through all the keys of the hash table in sorted order
    # Note: does not change %calendar -- hashes are intrisically unsorted
 }
