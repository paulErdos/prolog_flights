<h2>2.1 Map colorings </h2>
   A famous problem in mathematics concerns coloring adjacent planar regions.
 Like  cartographic maps, it  is required that, whatever colors are actually
used, no two adjacent  regions may not have the same color.  Two regions
are considered adjacent provided they  share some boundary line segment.
 Consider the following map.  
<p>  </p>

<br>

 </center>
 
<p>  We have given numerical names to the regions.  To represent which regions
are adjacent,  consider also the following graph.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<center> <img src="f2_1_2.gif" alt="Fig. 2.1.2">
 <br>
 Fig. 2.1.2<br>
 </center>
   
<p>    Here we have erased the original boundaries and have instead drawn
an arc between the names  of two regions, provided they were adjacent in
the original drawing.  In fact, the adjacency  graph will convey all of the
original adjacency information.  A Prolog representation for  the adjacency
information could be represented by the following <em>unit</em> clauses,
or facts.   </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre> <br>adjacent(1,2).         adjacent(2,1). <br>adjacent(1,3).         adjacent(3,1). <br>adjacent(1,4).         adjacent(4,1). <br>adjacent(1,5).         adjacent(5,1). <br>adjacent(2,3).         adjacent(3,2). <br>adjacent(2,4).         adjacent(4,2). <br>adjacent(3,4).         adjacent(4,3). <br>adjacent(4,5).         adjacent(5,4). <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
  If these clauses were loaded into Prolog, we could observe the following
behavior for  some goals.  
<p>  </p>
<blockquote>  
  <pre>?- adjacent(2,3). <br>yes <br>?- adjacent(5,3). <br>no <br>?- adjacent(3,R). <br>R = 1 ; <br>R = 2 ; <br>R = 4 ; <br>no <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
 
<p> One could declare colorings for the regions in Prolog also using unit
clauses.  </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>  
  <pre>color(1,red,a).    color(1,red,b). <br>color(2,blue,a).   color(2,blue,b). <br>color(3,green,a).  color(3,green,b). <br>color(4,yellow,a). color(4,blue,b). <br>color(5,blue,a).   color(5,green,b). <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
 
<p> Here we have encoded 'a' and 'b' colorings.  We want to write a Prolog
definition of a  conflictive coloring, meaning that two adjacent regions
have the same color.  For example,  here is a Prolog clause, or rule to that
effect.  </p>
<blockquote>  
  <pre>conflict(Coloring) :- <br>   adjacent(X,Y), <br>   color(X,Color,Coloring), <br>   color(Y,Color,Coloring). <br></pre>
    </blockquote>
   For example,  
<p>  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>?- conflict(a). <br>no <br>?- conflict(b). <br>yes <br>?- conflict(Which). <br>Which = b <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
   Here is another version of 'conflict' that has more logical parameters.
 
<p>   </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>conflict(R1,R2,Coloring) :- <br>   adjacent(R1,R2), <br>   color(R1,Color,Coloring), <br>   color(R2,Color,Coloring). <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
  
<p> Prolog allows and distinguishes the two definitions of 'conflict'; one
has one logical  parameter ('conflict/1') and the other has three ('conflict/3').
 Now we have  </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>?- conflict(R1,R2,b). <br>R1 = 2   R2 = 4 <br>?- conflict(R1,R2,b),color(R1,C,b). <br>R1 = 2   R2 = 4   C = blue <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
 
<p> The last goal means that regions 2 and 4 are adjacent and both are blue.
 Grounded  instances like 'conflict(2,4,b)' are said to be consequences of
the Prolog program.  One  way to demonstrate such a consequence is to draw
a <em>program clause tree</em> having the  consequence as the root of the
tree, use clauses of the program to branch the tree, and  eventually produce
a finite tree having all true leaves.  For example, the following clause
 tree can be constructed using fully grounded instances (no variables) of
clauses of the  program. </p>

make digrams like  the one in the previous display,  <a

<p> The bottom leftmost branch drawn in the tree corresponds to the unit
clause  </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>adjacent(2,4). <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
 
<p> which is equivalent in Prolog to the clause  </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>adjacent(2,4) :- true. <br></pre>
 </blockquote>
 
<p>  Now, on the other hand, 'conflict(1,3,b)' is not a consequence of the
Prolog program  because it is not possible to construct a finite finite clause
tree using grounded  clauses of P containing all 'true' leaves.  Likewise,
'conflict(a)' is not a consequence of the  program, as one would expect.
 We will have more to say about program clause trees in  subsequent sections.
 </p>
<p>  We will revisit the coloring problem again in Section 2.9, where we
will develop a Prolog  program that can compute all possible colorings (given
colors to color with).  The famous  Four Color Conjecture was that no planar
map requires more than four different colors.   This was proved by Appel
and Haken (1976).  The solution used a computer program (<em>not</em>  Prolog)
to check on many specific cases of planar maps, in order to rule out possible
troublesome  cases.  The map in in Fig. 2.1.1 does require at least four
colors; for example ... </p>

<p> <em>Exercise 2.1</em>  If a map has N regions, then estimate how many
computations may have to  be done in order to determine whether or not the
coloring is in conflict.  Argue using  program clause trees. </p>
