Numerous good perl tutorials and books online.

Example of perl code that reads files and pattern matches some of the lines:
http://www2.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/:/Languages/perl/Examples2/cat.perl

Example of perl code that reads files and contains subroutines:
http://www2.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/:/Languages/perl/Examples1/huffman.perl

Example of getopts in perl:

SCORE file - Make sure you address each item in the SCORE file:
http://www2.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps112-wm/:/Assignments/asg1-perl-pmake/.score/SCORE


handle options
open file
read in targets (pattern match to find comments, macros, target names, prereqs, commands)
for each target to build
  build its prereqs
  if target is "obsolete" (aka if prereqs or files are newer than target.  Consider keeping a map from target to timestamp, intialized in some sane way)
    build it (run its commands), store new timestamp
exit with a correct exit code!

You're welcome to attend both labs.

OR
perldoc -f system
perldoc Getopt::Std

example (reads a line of input from infile into line)
my $line = <$infile>

SCORE file and .score/testN directories

to run perl programs, you can do this:
perl pmake
BUT for your assignments you need to do it this way
chmod +x pmake
THEN
pmake
WHERE pmake is the name of your perl script
