<H2>8.5  Structure diagrams and Prolog </H2>
<P>
The diagrams considered are finite graphs whose nodes and edges have a finite number of properties.  
Computational logic can specify diagrams and reason about them.  The visual 
appearance of such a diagram is expressed using factual logic. 
Factual logic describes the factual appearance of a particular diagram.  
General properties of  
diagram objects and higher-order relationships between them are represented in 
generic logic.  Generic logic describes the general meanings that one intends certain kinds of diagrams to have.  Some examples are given to motivate this 
approach, including some executable Prolog code.   A definition for the 
sameness of meaning of two diagrams is also discussed briefly. 

<h3><i>Structure diagrams (mathematical formulation)</i></h3>

The diagrams under consideration consist of a finite number of <i>nodes</i> and a finite 
number of <i>edges</i>. So such a diagram is a finite graph.  Each edge 
connects two nodes (perhaps the same node).  Each node or edge has a finite number of 
<i>properties</i>. Properties are specified using a finite set of <i>keys</i> and a 
finite set of <i>values</i>. 
Suppose that diagram <b>D,</b> has sets of nodes <b>N</b> and edges <b>E</b>.  Define <b>O</b> to 
be the union of sets 
<b>N</b> and <b>E</b>.  <b>O</b> is the set of <i>objects</i> in the diagram <b>D</b>.  Let <b>K</b> be the 
finite set of keys (or 
attributes) and let <b>V</b> be the finite set of values that the keys can have.  The property 
function is 

<blockquote>
 &pi; :   <b>O</b> &times; <b>K</b> --> <b>V</b>
</blockquote>

This property function assigns a value to (object,key) pairs.  
In practice, this may be a partial 
function (not defined for all pairs).  
For example, the "color of edge e is red" might be 
represented as &pi;(e,color) = red.  Generally speaking, the equation 

<blockquote>
&pi;(o,k) = v
</blockquote>

means that the diagram object o has property value v for key k.  
Keys and values  specify visual attributes of the  objects appearing in 
diagrams.  
<p>
Let us call these diagrams <i>structure diagrams</i>.  
Structure diagrams can be used to represent most of the 
salient features of many kinds of diagrams, including class diagrams, 
finite state diagrams, flow charts, lattice diagrams, decorated trees, 
decorated graphs, proof diagrams and proof trees, and others. 
However, the definition probably cannot adequately represent 
others kinds of diagrams, like Venn diagrams or Euler diagrams.  

<h3><i>Structure diagrams (OO formulation)</i></h3>

<br><i>Figure 1.</i> Diagram objects
</center>
<p>
The diagram in <i>Figure 1</i> shows an object-oriented class diagram depicting relationships 
between diagrams, nodes and edges.  If one is familiar with this kind of diagram, 
then its 
intended meaning is probably quite clear.  It is a class diagram characterizing 
diagrams. 
This particular diagram intends to say that a diagram in general has nodes and edges; 
nodes and edges are kinds 
of diagram objects that can have labels, colors, fonts, font colors which can draw 
themselves in a graphics context.  Nodes have a location x and y and a calculated width and 
height.  Edges connect two nodes. In addition there are particular kinds of nodes and edges, 
like oval nodes or line edges, for example.  In addition, the classes defining all of these various objects 
belong to a package called 'dgmr.diagram'. 
<p>
It is possible to use many kinds of attributes (like color, shape, font, etc.)  to indicate some 
meaning in a diagram.  For example, the abstract classes in the diagram are shaded gray to 
distinguish them from classes that can be instantiated.   Most OO modeling diagrams 
would have represented this relationship with an <tt> &lt;&lt;abstract&gt;&gt; </tt> tag.
<p>
<i>Figure 1</i> represents a design artifact for a software system \cite{Diagram} that was used by the author to 
actually draw the diagram.  The diagram is a useful working example for the following sections.


<h3><i>The factual logic of structure diagrams</i></h3>

The <i>factual logic</i> of a diagram describes facts about that particular diagram.  
Primarily, these are the facts of appearance.  Facts of appearance describe 
what the diagram looks like:  labels, shapes or types of nodes and edges, 
connectedness of edges, position of nodes, dimensions of nodes, etc.  
Also, there could be facts of arrangement like declarations of 
nodes or edges belonging to a particular diagram. 
For our factual logic framework we use logical expressions, or clauses, having the 
following Prolog forms: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
     node(+Node)  
     edge(+Edge,+FromNode,+ToNode) 
     property(+Object,+Key,+Value)
</pre>
</blockquote>

The first form expresses that node belongs to, or is part of the diagram.  
The second form 
expresses that edge connects from node1 to node2.  
The third form expresses that an object 
(node or edge) has a property value for a particular key.  
Such a framework is a kind of 
<i>semantic network</i>. 
<p>
Given an intended factual framework, the appearances of diagrams are translated into 
factual clauses.  Most interesting are automatic translations to logic using software that can 
inspect the diagram objects.  For example, the software that drew the previous diagram  
has a subsystem that generates factual logic code. (See the link thereto at the end of this section.)  That software (written in Java) 
produces code similar to the following sample code.  This sample code expresses some of 
the facts about the previous diagram.  The abundant actual code produced (file <tt>diagram.pl</tt>) 
is shown reformatted 
(and simplified) for display here, and a very large part of it was omitted.  

<blockquote>
<pre>
   % nodes
   node(node_0) .
     ...
   % edges
   edge(edge_0,node_1,node_2).
     ...
   % property key = label
   property(node_0,label,'Diagram').
     ...
   % property key = type
   property(node_0,type,'dgmr.diagram.DataNode').
     ...
   % property key = color
   property(node_0,color,[255,255,255]).
     ...
   % property key = position
   property(node_0,position,[38,55]).
</pre>
</blockquote>

The logic code generator used the values of object instance variables and the concept of 
Java introspection to generate the factual logic. 
<p>
If the diagrams have more generalized content, like images, then the values of 
certain keys would need to be links to that content, or some other descriptor. 
<p>
What kind of logical specification is reasonable to use?   In this section 
we use code that can be computed as-is with Prolog, or can be loaded into a Prolog 
logic meta-
interpreter.  Other, similar, formulations might be appropriate to use with 
specialized Prolog logic meta-interpreters.

<p>

<h3><i>The generic logic of structure diagrams</i></h3>

<i>Generic logic</i> describes all of the 
intended  or general meanings about a class of related diagrams.  
This is accomplished by specifying rules 
that define the intended concepts.    
The generic rules apply to a collection of diagrams in a particular area of application. 
<p>
For a specific example, consider the concept of inheritance in an object-oriented class 
hierarchy diagram.  The usual kind of rule for depicting this relationship diagrammatically 
is to draw a certain kind of terminal edge (usually some kind of open arrowhead) from the 
child class to the parent class (with intermediate line links from the child class allowed).  
This general convention applies then to all hierarchy diagrams.   
Here is some sample code (file <tt>extends.pl</tt>) to compute the inheritance relationship.  This generic rule 
base is suitable for combining with the factual rules having the given  
predicate formats.  

<blockquote>
<pre>
   %% class S extends class P
    extends(S,P) :- 
       node(NS),
       classNode(NS), 
       property(NS,'label',S),
       node(NP),
       classNode(NP),
      property(NP,'label',P),
      connectedByArrow(NS,NP).
   %% class S extends class P, Nth removed
   extends(S,P,1) :- 
      extends(S,P).
   extends(S,P,N) :- 
      extends(S,M), 
      extends(M,P,N1),
      N is N1+1.
   %% Is there an "extends" edge between X and Y?
   connectedByArrow(X,Y) :- 
      edge(E,X,Y),
      closedArrow(E).
   connectedByArrow(X,Y) :- 
      edge(E,X,C), 
      property(C,'type','dgmr.diagram.ConnectorNode'),
      lineEdge(E),
      connectedByArrow(C,Y).
   %% Definition of "closed arrow" edge
   closedArrow(E) :- 
      ( property(E,'type','dgmr.diagram.ArrowEdge') | 
         property(E,'type','dgmr.diagram.CubicEdge') ),
      property(E,'tip','closed_tip').
   %% Definition of "line" edge
   lineEdge(E) :-
      ( property(E,'type','dgmr.diagram.ArrowEdge') | 
          property(E,'type','dgmr.diagram.CubicEdge') ),
      property(E,'tip','no_tip').
   %% Definition of "class" node
   classNode(N) :- 
      property(N,'type','dgmr.diagram.DataNode') |  
      property(N,'type','dgmr.diagram.RectNode').
</pre>
</blockquote>

If the factual logic (file <tt>diagram.pl</tt> generated for the diagram 
in  <i>Figure 1</i>) and this generic  
rulebase (file <tt>extends.pl</tt>) are both loaded into the same Prolog context, 
then the following shows answers
extracted by Prolog.

<blockquote>
<pre>
?- [diagram,extends].  % load these two files
% diagram compiled 0.00 sec, 20,760 bytes
% extends compiled 0.00 sec, 2,200 bytes

?- extends(X,Y).   % DIRECT EXTENSION

X = 'Edge'
Y = 'DiagramObject' ;

X = 'Node'
Y = 'DiagramObject' ;

X = 'ArrowEdge'
Y = 'Edge' ;

X = 'DataNode'
Y = 'Node' ;

No

?- extends(X,Y,N).   % DIRECT or INDIRECT EXTENSION

X = 'Edge'
Y = 'DiagramObject'
N = 1 ;

X = 'Node'
Y = 'DiagramObject'
N = 1 ;

X = 'ArrowEdge'
Y = 'Edge'
N = 1 ;

X = 'DataNode'
Y = 'Node'
N = 1 ;

X = 'ArrowEdge'
Y = 'DiagramObject'
N = 2 ;

X = 'DataNode'
Y = 'DiagramObject'
N = 2 ;

No
?- 
</pre>
</blockquote>

The answers produced indicate first inheritance relations once removed (X inherits from Y 
directly) and then inheritance relations twice removed (X inherits from some W which in 
turn inherits from Y), and so on.  
<p>
Notice that <tt>extends(-,-,-)</tt> could be used to compute an object oriented software 
metric:  The "inheritance diameter" of a system, which is the longest inheritance path for any 
object in the system (how removed inheritance could be). This 
modification is an exercise for the reader. 
<p>

<i>Exercise 8.5.1.</i>  Implement this inheritance diameter metric.
<p>
The current example, inheritance, is a little more complicated than the casual reader may at first 
appreciate.  The presentation up to this point depends upon the not unreasonable assumption 
that the human diagram creator has drawn 
line edges in the direction of an inheritance arrow. For example, the line edge in <i>Figure 1</i> 
was drawn from 
the node labelled "ArrowEdge" to the little round connector node (and not in the reverses direction.
Were it the case that this line 
edge  had been drawn in the opposite direction, no one could see the difference visually.
The diagram would have exactly the same appearance.   
But the factual logic 
would not have sufficient information to produce a conclusion of inheritance (X = 'ArrowEdge', 
Y = 'DiagramObject'). 
If our intention was to allow the connecting line edges to have been drawn in either 
direction then, we could not use a simple Prolog program to interpret our fact base 
(unfortunately!).  
<P>
<i>Exercise 8.5.2.</i>  Show how to modify <tt>extends.pl</tt> so that the line edges to 
the connector nodes could be drawn in either direction. (Hint: only one line needs change.)

<p>
Some intensions can be deduced from the overall edgewise connectedness of nodes, like 
the inheritance example just given.  Other intensions might use other facts from the 
factual rulebase.  For example, "belonging to the package" in the previous 
diagram could be computed using the actual positions of the nodes (where they are located 
in the view), relative to the visual "package corral".  Still other intensions can be based 
upon the textual (or other) content associated with a node, such as the fields, constructors 
or methods of a class node, or with constraint notes attached to the same items. 
We do believe that resolution logic using definite clauses should suffice for much of specification 
logic.  However, care is needed to write these Prolog specifications so as to avoid 
cyclic graph definitions that would cause infinite recursion during queries.
<p>
<i>Exercise 8.5.3 (Big Project)</i>
Design and implement a prolog program that is able to analyze a website and 
creates a diagram for its contents.  Design generic logic for 
analyzing the contents of a website via analysis of its 
diagram, and build the query engine for this.  This is a kind of 
<i>expert system for the semantic web</i>.
<p>




<h3><i>The meanings of structure diagrams</i></h3>

Logically speaking, what is the meaning of a structure diagram?  The following definition 
uses logic programming theory. See the refernce Lloyd(1984, 1987).
<p>
Assume that the 
factual rulebase <b>F</b> consists of unit 
clauses (as described previously) and that the generic rulebase <b>G</b> is a datalog program (positive 
definite clauses, no negation, and no built-in predicates like sequences or lists).
The meaning of the diagram corresponding to facts <b>F</b>
and generic rules <b>G</b> is defined to be the 
<i>minimal model</i> of the combined rulebases <b>F</b> &cup; <b>G</b>.
<p>

Suppose that <b>G<sub>F</sub></b> is the set of all instances of rules in <b>G</b> which 
have been grounded using terms 
generated by the constants and function symbols from <b>F</b>.
The minimal 
model <b>M</b> can be defined inductively as follows. 

<blockquote>
<b>M</b><sub>0</sub> = <b>E</b> 
</blockquote>

<b>M</b><sub>0</sub> contains just the facts <b>E</b>.  For k &gt; 0 define

<blockquote>
<b>M</b><sub>k</sub> = { A | A :- B<sub>1</sub>,...,B<sub>n</sub> in <b>G<sub>F</sub></b>, B<sub>i</sub> in <b>M</b><sub>k-1</sub>, for all i} &cup; <b>M</b><sub>k-1</sub>
</blockquote>

Each <b>M</b><sub>k</sub> contains all derived consequences using rules in <b>G</b> 
and derived consequences from <b>M</b><sub>j</sub>, for j &lt;  k.   
<p>
Finally, 
<blockquote>
<b>M</b> = <b>M</b>(<b>F</b> &cup; <b>G</b>) = &cup; <b>M</b><sub>k</sub>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note again that this minimal model always contains 
the factual rulebase. 
<p>
Using a common generic rulebase <b>G</b>, two diagams <b>D</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>D</b><sub>2</sub>
<i>have the same 
intended meaning</i> provided 
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>M</b>(<b>F</b><sub>1</sub> &cup; <b>G</b>) \ <b>F</b><sub>1</sub> = <b>M</b>(<b>F</b><sub>2</sub> &cup; <b>G</b>) \ <b>F</b><sub>2</sub>
</blockquote>
<p>
where <b>F</b><sub>1</sub> is the extensional rule base determined by <b>D</b><sub>1</sub> 
and <b>F</b><sub>2</sub> is the extensional rule base 
determined by <b>D</b><sub>2</sub>  (and where "\" denotes set difference). 
Intuitively speaking: <i>  the two diagrams have the same intended meaning provided they 
have the same consequences,  even 
though they may have somewhat different (factual) appearances</i>.

<p>
For example, in the previous inheritance example, it is clear that the meaning of the 
diagram should not change if some of the nodes were moved a little. We say "a little" 
because we could easily make a scramble of the visual appearance and thus lose visual 
impact, let alone intuitive meaning.  Of course, if <b>G</b> were to depend fairly strictly on 
position then nodes could not be moved very much before the intended meaning of the 
diagram would change. 
<p>
For the following example, consult <i>Figure 2</i>.    Suppose 
that in a certain kind of diagram some intensions (rules) are specified in <b>G</b><sub>1</sub> for 
diamond edges which are green.  Suppose that we consider all other intensions to be the 
same but that now blue solid arrow edges are used everywhere to specify what was 
previously meant for green diamond edges, giving new intensions <b>G</b><sub>2</sub>.  Suppose further that 
diagrams <b>D</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>D</b><sub>2</sub> are the same except that wherever 
<b>D</b><sub>1</sub> has green diamond edges, 
<b>D</b><sub>2</sub> has blue solid arrow edges.  Then it makes sense to say 
that <b>D</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>D</b><sub>2</sub> have the same 
meaning.
<center>
<img src="SameMeaning.jpg" ALT="Figure 2"> <br>
<i>Figure 2.</i> Two diagrams with same intended meaning
</center>
 <p>

A mathematical characterization is as follows.  Suppose that <b>D</b><sub>1</sub> 
and <b>D</b><sub>2</sub> are diagrams 
having generic rules <b>G</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>G</b><sub>2</sub> and suppose that 
there is a one-to-one <i>analogy function</i> 

<blockquote>
<b>&alpha;</b> : <b>G</b><sub>1</sub> --> <b>G</b><sub>2</sub>
</blockquote>

which maps node specs to corresponding node specs, edge specs to corresponding edge 
specs, and property specs to corresponding property specs.  Then we say that the analogy a 
assigns the same meaning to <b>D</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>D</b><sub>2</sub> provided 

<blockquote>
<b>M</b>(<b>&alpha;</b>(<b>F</b><sub>1</sub>) &cup; <b>G</b><sub>2</sub>) \ <b>&alpha;</b>(<b>F</b><sub>1</sub>) = 
<b>M</b>(<b>F</b><sub>2</sub> &cup; <b>G</b><sub>2</sub>) \ <b>F</b><sub>2</sub>
</blockquote>

<i>Exercise 8.5.4</i>
Earlier in this section we gave an alternate graphical metaphor for abstract classes.  We 
said that a class node with a gray color could be used to mean that the class was an 
abstract class.  We said that an alternate way to represent abstract classes was to use 
an <tt>&lt;&lt;abstract&gt;&gt;</tt> label somewhere in the diagrammatic specification 
(e.g., <i> UML</i>).  How do the 
definitions in this subsection cover this particular concept?  What is the analogy function?
<p>
<i>Exercise 8.5.5 (Project)</i>  Implement analogy functions in a general way   
so that diagrams can be computed as having the same meaning.

<p>
This brief discussion has 
avoided many technical details.  The concepts seem very theoretical, but 
could be of considerable practical importance.
<p>
In addition, if <b>G</b> is not a simple datalog logic program, then one must 
define meaning in terms of 
some other logic program semantics.  For example, if I contains rules with negation 
(intended to be computed as negation-as-failure) then we could use some kind of 
so-called 
closed-world semantics. See reference Lloyd(1984, 1987) again.  This semantics 
is nonmonotonic, which in the 
current context of diagrams means that some conclusions about diagrams could 
be blocked by adding new nodes, edges or properties.  For example, suppose that we 
had a 
rule that said that a certain conclusion holds as long as some involved node 
is not blue.   If 
that conclusion holds for a certain diagram and then we change the color of the crucial 
node to blue, then the conclusion becomes false.  That never happens for 
positive definite 
logic.  Other logics (say the possibility of facts with explicit classical negation and rules 
containing same) would require other appropriate semantics. 

<p>
There <i>may</i> be better logics for computing consequences of diagrams.
