<h2>
2.7 Prolog lists and sequences</h2>

<h3>
<i>Lists</i></h3>
Prolog uses brackets [...] as a list builder. The notation [X|Y] refers
to a list whose first element is X and whose tail is Y. A finite list can
be explicitly enumerated, such as [1,2,3,4]. The following three definitions
should make sense to a Lisp programmer, where 'car' refers to the first
element of a list, 'cdr' refers to the tail or rest of the list, and 'cons'
is the list constructor.
<blockquote>
<pre>car([X|Y],X).

cdr([X|Y],Y).

cons(X,R,[X|R]).

</pre>
</blockquote>
meaning ...
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The head (car) of [X|Y] is X.</i></li>

<li>
<i>The tail (cdr) of [X|Y] is Y.</i></li>

<li>
<i>Putting X at the head and Y as the tail constructs (cons) the list [X|R].</i></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
However, we will see that these explicit definitions are unneeded. A list
whose head is X and whose tail is Y can just be referred to using the Prolog
term [X|Y]. Conversely, if the list can be unified with the Prolog term
'[X|Y]' then the first element of the list is bound to (unified with) X
and the tail of the list is bound to Y.
<p>Many of the predicates discussed in this section are "built-in" for
many Prolog interpreters.
<p>Consider the following definition of the predicate 'member/2'.
<blockquote>
<pre>member(X,[X|R]).
member(X,[Y|R]) :- member(X,R).</pre>
</blockquote>
One can read the clauses the following way, respectively:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<i>X is a member of a list whose first element is X.</i></li>

<li>
<i>X is a member of a list whose tail is R if X is a member of R.</i></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
This program can be used in numerous ways. One can test membership:
<blockquote>
<pre>?- member(2,[1,2,3]).
Yes</pre>
</blockquote>
One can generate members of a list:
<blockquote>
<pre>?- member(X,[1,2,3]).
X = 1 ;
X = 2 ;
X = 3 ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
Here is a derivation tree showing how this last goal generated all of the
answers.
<center>
<p><img SRC="f2_7.gif" height=321 width=414 ALT="Fig. 2.7">
<br>Fig. 2.7</center>

<p>Each left branch corresponds to a match (unification) against the first
clause for 'member' and each right branch corresponds to a match against
the second clause. The subgoal 'member(X,[])' on the lowest right branch
will not match the head of any 'member' clause. In particular '[]' will
not unify with a pattern of the form '[X|R]' because the latter represents
a list with at least one element.
<p>We will find many other uses for 'member'. This example query ...
<blockquote>
<pre>?- member([3,Y], [[1,a],[2,m],[3,z],[4,v],[3,p]]).
Y = z ;
Y = p ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
... suggests a use where one intends to search in order to find elements
paired with a specified element. Here is another, finding elements of a
list which satisfy some constraint:
<blockquote>
<pre>?- member(X,[23,45,67,12,222,19,9,6]), Y is X*X, Y &lt; 100.
X = 9&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = 81 ;
X = 6&nbsp;&nbsp; Y = 36 ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
The definition for 'member' is usually written
<blockquote>
<pre>member(X,[X|_]).
member(X,[_|R]) :- member(X,R).</pre>
</blockquote>
where '_' (underscore) designates a "don't-care" variable, usually called
anonymous variables. In general, such variables have names whose first
character is the underscore. In effect, they match any Prolog term, but
no variable binding results from the free match. Notice that this is consistent
with the original intentions of the definition of 'member'. Not having
to bind values to anonymous variables saves a little run-space and run-time.
<p>Related to 'member' is the following definition for 'takeout'.
<blockquote>
<pre>takeout(X,[X|R],R).
takeout(X,[F|R],[F|S]) :- takeout(X,R,S).</pre>
</blockquote>
These clauses can be paraphrased in English as follows:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<i>When X is taken out of [X|R], R results.</i></li>

<li>
<i>When X is taken out of the tail of [X|R], [X|S] results, where S is
the result of taking X out of R.</i></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>?- takeout(X,[1,2,3],L).
X=1&nbsp; L=[2,3] ;
X=2&nbsp; L=[1,3] ;
X=3&nbsp; L=[1,2] ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
Notice that it would not be appropriate to use any anonymous variables
in the definition of 'takeout'. Here is a program clause tree showing that
'takeout(3,[1,2,3],[1,2])' is a consequence of the definition. Pay particular
attention to exactly how the clauses are used to construct the tree.
<center><pre>takeout(3,[1,2,3],[1,2])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
takeout(3,[2,3],[2])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
takeout(3,[3],[])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; true</pre></center>
The following goal,
<blockquote>
<pre>?- takeout(3,W,[a,b,c]).
W = [3,a,b,c] ;
W = [a,3,b,c] ;
W = [a,b,3,c] ;
W = [a,b,c,3] ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
shows that 'takeout(X,Z,W)' can also be interpreted as "insert X into W
to produce Z". That is, 'takeout' got its name from just one of its uses.
Of course, one could define
<blockquote>
<pre>putin(X,L,R) :- takeout(X,R,L).</pre>
</blockquote>
Here is a definition for appending, or concatenating, two Prolog lists.
<blockquote>
<pre>append([X|Y],Z,[X|W]) :- append(Y,Z,W).
append([],X,X).</pre>
</blockquote>
Several kinds of goals are possible:
<blockquote>
<pre>?- append([1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]).
Yes

?- append([1,2,3],[4,5],A).
A = [1,2,3,4,5]

?- append([1,2,3],W,[1,2,3,4,5]).
W = [4,5]

... and so on.</pre>
</blockquote>
<i>Exercise 2.7.1</i> Consider the following alternate definition for member:
<blockquote>
<pre>member(X,[_|R) :- member(X,R).
member(X,[X|_]).</pre>
</blockquote>
(a) Show that this program would have exactly the same consequences as
the original version. (b) Explain, however, how and why this version could
produce different Prolog goal behavior.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.2</i> Draw a Prolog derivation tree for the goal '?-
append([1,2],[a,b,c],A)' . Explain how it is that the first value '[1,2]'
is copied in order to compute the result A.
<p>Reversing a list can be done with
<blockquote>
<pre>reverse([X|Y],Z,W) :- reverse(Y,[X|Z],W).
reverse([],X,X).</pre>
</blockquote>
This program illustrates Prolog's approach to an important strategy --
using an accumulating parameter (the middle variable) -- to accumulate
a list answer until the computation is finished. For example, consider
the following (partial) derivation tree
<center><pre>?- reverse([1,2,3],[],A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp; reverse([2,3],[1],A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp; reverse([3],[2,1],A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp; reverse([],[3,2,1],A)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; true&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A = [3,2,1]</pre></center>
where the first 'reverse' clause is use three times, and then the second
'reverse' clause is used to "capture" the answer by matching the second
and third arguments. One could use the following definition to "hide" the
accumulating parameter.
<blockquote>
<pre>reverse(A,R) :- reverse(A,[],R).</pre>
</blockquote>
<i>Exercise 2.7.3</i> Write a two-parameter version of 'reverse' that does
not use the accumulating parameter idea. Use 'append' instead, for example,
where one rule would be paraphrased like this ...
<blockquote>reverse list [X|R] by reversing R to get T, then append T to
[X]</blockquote>
What about the efficiency of this version? Compare it to the given 'reverse'
above.
<p>Here is an interesting definition designed to produce all possible permutations
of a list.
<blockquote>
<pre>perm([X|Y],Z) :- perm(Y,W), takeout(X,Z,W).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
perm([],[]).</pre>
</blockquote>
Think of 'takeout(X,Z,W)' as being used in the "X put into W yields Z"
sense here. Then the definitions could paraphrased as follows:
<blockquote>
<ul><li>
<i>Z is a permutation of [X|Y] provided W is a permutation of Y and then
X is put into W to produce Z .</i></li>

<li>
<i>[] is the (only) permutation of [].</i></li>
</ul></blockquote>
Here is a sample goal for 'perm':
<blockquote>
<pre>?- perm([1,2,3],P).
P = [1,2,3] ;
P = [2,1,3] ;
P = [2,3,1] ;
P = [1,3,2] ;
P = [3,1,2] ;
P = [3,2,1] ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
The user should try the goal '?- perm(P,[1,2,3]).'
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.4</i> Construct a program clause tree having all true
leaves for 'perm([a,b,c],[c,b,a])'.
<p>It is common to represent sets as Prolog lists. This representation
has some flaws, such as the fact that Prolog lists are inherently ordered
(sets are not), and a list can have multiple occurrences of a particular
element (sets do not). However, the list representation is very convenient.
Set membership can be computed using the 'member' relation for lists previously
discussed. Subsets can be tested using
<blockquote>
<pre>subset([X|R],S) :- member(X,S), subset(R,S).
subset([],_).</pre>
</blockquote>
Goals like
<blockquote>
<pre>?- subset([4,3],[2,3,5,4]).
Yes</pre>
</blockquote>
work fine. Why would '?- subset([1,2],W)' and '?- subset(A,[1,2,3])' not
be reasonable goals?
<p>Union and intersection can be approximated using the following Prolog
list versions:
<blockquote>
<pre>union([X|Y],Z,W) :- member(X,Z),&nbsp; union(Y,Z,W).
union([X|Y],Z,[X|W]) :- \+ member(X,Z), union(Y,Z,W).
union([],Z,Z).
&nbsp;
intersection([X|Y],M,[X|Z]) :- member(X,M), intersection(Y,M,Z).
intersection([X|Y],M,Z) :- \+ member(X,M), intersection(Y,M,Z).
intersection([],M,[]).</pre>
</blockquote>
These are intended to be used for goals where the first two variables already
have a list value. Sometimes this intention is indicated by writing something
like 'union(+,+,-)' to indicate the intended variable profile. For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>?- union([1,2,3,4],[1,a,b,4],A).
A = [2,3,1,a,b,4]
&nbsp;
?- intersection([1,2,3,4],[1,a,b,4],B).
B = [1,4]</pre>
</blockquote>
Why would goals like '?- union(X,[2,3],[1,3,a,2])' cause difficulty?
<p>Some run-time inefficiency results from having to rematch the heads
of clauses for both of the definitions. Here is an alternate version of
union, using ! instead:
<blockquote>
<pre>union([X|Y],Z,W) :-&nbsp;
&nbsp; member(X,Z),&nbsp;
&nbsp; !,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* do not&nbsp; use next clauses */
&nbsp; union(Y,Z,W).&nbsp;
union([X|Y],Z,[X|W]) :- union(Y,Z,W).
union([],Z,Z).</pre>
</blockquote>
<i>Exercise 2.7.5</i> Design and test 'delete(X,L,R)' which is intended
to delete all occurrences of X from list L to produce result R.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.6</i> Design and test 'prune(A,B)' which is intended
to remove multiple occurrences of elements from A to produce result B.
For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>?- prune([a,1,b,2,a,3,a,4,b],B).
B = [a,1,b,2,3,4]</pre>
</blockquote>
Try to make it so that B has remaining elements in the order that they
occurred in A.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.7</i> Design and test 'prefix(A,B)' which tests to see
if A is a list prefix of B, and which can generate prefixes of a given
list. For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>?- prefix([1,2,3],[1,2,3,4,5]).
yes

?- prefix([1,2],[1,a,2,3]).
No&nbsp;

?- prefix(W,[1,2,3]).
W = [] ;
W = [1] ;
W = [1,2] ;
W = [1,2,3] ;
No</pre>
</blockquote>
Draw a program clause tree showing that 'prefix([1,2],[1,2,3])' is a consequence
of your program.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.8</i> Design a Prolog predicate 'segment', that tests
whether its first list argument is a contiguous segment contained anywhere
within the second list argument. For example,
<blockquote>
<pre>?- segment([a,b,c],[1,c,a,b,c,3]).
Yes
&nbsp;
?- segment([a,b],[c,a,c,b]).
No</pre>
</blockquote>
Draw a clause tree showing that 'segment([a,b,c],[1,c,a,b,c,3])' is a consequence
of your program.
<p>Various sorting strategies can be implemented using lists in prolog.
Here is a Prolog version of merge sort, with intended profile mergesort(+,-).
<blockquote>
<pre>mergesort([],[]).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* covers special case */
mergesort([A],[A]).
mergesort([A,B|R],S) :-&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; split([A,B|R],L1,L2),
&nbsp;&nbsp; mergesort(L1,S1),
&nbsp;&nbsp; mergesort(L2,S2),
&nbsp;&nbsp; merge(S1,S2,S).

split([],[],[]).
split([A],[A],[]).
split([A,B|R],[A|Ra],[B|Rb]) :-&nbsp; split(R,Ra,Rb).

merge(A,[],A).
merge([],B,B).
merge([A|Ra],[B|Rb],[A|M]) :-&nbsp; A =&lt; B, merge(Ra,[B|Rb],M).
merge([A|Ra],[B|Rb],[B|M]) :-&nbsp; A > B,&nbsp; merge([A|Ra],Rb,M).</pre>
</blockquote>
Here is a sample goal:
<blockquote>
<pre>?- mergesort([4,3,6,5,9,1,7],S).
S=[1,3,4,5,6,7,9]</pre>
</blockquote>
Prolog list sorting routines suffer all of the relative space and time
inefficiencies related with sorting dynamic structures, but often have
very cogent specifications in Prolog.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.9</i> Design a Prolog implementation of selection sort
for lists of numbers. Test your program using various sample runs.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.10</i> Design a Prolog implementation of insertion sort
for lists of numbers. Test your program using various sample runs.
<h3>
<b><i>Sequences</i></b></h3>
The kind of sequences most used in Prolog are "comma" sequences. There
is no empty sequence (unlike for lists). The shortest sequence has one
element. Longer sequences have elements separated by commas ",". An appropriate
declaration for the comma operator would be
<blockquote>
<pre>:- op(1000,xfy,',').</pre>
</blockquote>
meaning that comma is right-associative with precedence 1000. (The comma
operator is actually built-in.) Here is some Prolog behavior.
<blockquote>
<pre>?- (H,T) = (1,2,3,4).
H = 1
T = 2,3,4&nbsp;

?- (a) = a.&nbsp;
Yes

?- (H,T) = (a).
No

?- (A,B,C) = (1,2,3,4,5).
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3,4,5</pre>
</blockquote>
Prolog clauses use comma sequences.
<blockquote>
<pre>?- assert((a(X) :- b(X),c(X),d(X))). %% Note parens around clause
X = G1056

?- clause(a(X),Body), Body=(First,Next).
First = b(G1176)
Next = c(G1176), d(G1176)
Body = b(G1176), c(G1176), d(G1176)
X = G1176</pre>
</blockquote>
Procesing sequences is similar to processing lists, except that the base
case for sequences is a unit sequence (one element), whereas for lists
the base case is for the empty list. For example, here is a program to
append comma sequences ...
<blockquote>
<pre>sequence_append((X,R),S,(X,T)) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sequence_append(R,S,T).
sequence_append((X),S,(X,S)).</pre>
</blockquote>
Note the use of cut (!) to make sure that the second clause is not available
as a alternate choice for multi-element sequences.
<blockquote>
<pre>?- sequence_append((1,2,3),(a,b,c,d),S).
S = 1, 2, 3, a, b, c, d</pre>
</blockquote>
<i>Exercise 2.7.11</i> Write a Prolog program to reverse a comma sequence.
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.12</i> Write a Prolog program to prune a comma sequence
(delete repeated top-level elements, keeping first, left-most, occurrence).
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.13</i> Write a Prolog program to test for membership
in a comma sequence (similar to member for lists).
<p>Other kinds of sequences can be defined by the user. For example, to
make left-associative sequences separated by '#', one might use an operator
declaration like this ...
<blockquote>
<pre>?- op(500,yfx,'#').
Yes

?- (A#B) = 1#2#3#4.
B = 4
A = 1 # 2 # 3</pre>
</blockquote>
Notice how left-associativity was what determined the bindings in the second
goal!
<p><i>Exercise 2.7.14</i> Write a Prolog program to test for membership
in a # sequence, as defined above. What is the main point of this exercise?
