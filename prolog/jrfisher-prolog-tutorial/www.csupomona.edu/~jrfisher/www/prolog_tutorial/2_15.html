<H2>2.15 Graph structures and paths</H2>

<P>As an example, consider the following connected graph: </P>

<P>The edges can be represented in Prolog as facts: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>edge(1,2).
edge(1,4).
edge(1,3).
edge(2,3).
edge(2,5).
edge(3,4).
edge(3,5).
edge(4,5).
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>To represent the fact that the edges are bi-directional we could either
add eight more 'edge' clauses (edge(2,1),etc.) or we could try a rule like:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE> (*)      edge(X,Y) :- edge(Y,X).
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This is not a good idea, however. To see why it is not a good idea,
try the following goal. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>?- edge(5,1).
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Notice that the rule (*) will be tried over and over in an infinite
loop, so the goal will not terminate. Try it! A better way to handle this
is to use a rule such as the following. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>connected(X,Y) :- edge(X,Y) ; edge(Y,X).
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note the use of disjunction ';' in this rule. This rule could have been
written as two rules: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>connected(X,Y) :- edge(X,Y).
connected(X,Y) :- edge(Y,X).
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>We wish to develop a Prolog definition which generates paths between
any two nodes of the graph. More specifically, we require the following
(kind of) behavior for the predicate 'paths'. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>?- path(1,5,P).
P = [1,2,5] ;
P = [1,2,3,5] ;
P = [1,2,3,4,5] ;
P = [1,4,5] ;
P = [1,4,3,5] ;
P = [1,4,3,2,5] ;
P = [1,3,5] ;
P = [1,3,4,5] ;
P = [1,3,2,5] ;
no
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The paths are represented by the list of nodes through which one must
travel to get from node 1 to node 5. Here is a definition for paths: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>path(A,B,Path) :-
       travel(A,B,[A],Q), 
       reverse(Q,Path).

travel(A,B,P,[B|P]) :- 
       connected(A,B).
travel(A,B,Visited,Path) :-
       connected(A,C),           
       C \== B,
       \+member(C,Visited),
       travel(C,B,[C|Visited],Path).  
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>A declarative reading for the first clause amounts to &quot;A path from
A to B is obtained if A and B are connected&quot;. A declarative reading
for the second clause amounts to &quot;A path from A to B is obtained provided
that A is connected to a node C different from B that is not on the previously
visited part of the path, and one continues finding a path from C to B&quot;.
Avoiding repeated nodes ensures that the program will not cycle endlessly.
</P>

<P><I>Exercise 2.15</I> Suppose that edges have lengths. How does one calculate
shortest paths between points in Prolog? </P>
