<h2>
6.1 Chapter 6 notes</h2>

Chapter 6 covers some basic material regarding mathematical and computational logic. 
The contents of this chapter were used as notes for part of a theoretical computer science course 
on automated reasoning at
the masters level from about 1995 until about 2001.  It was assumed
that the student had at least one background course in logic, with at least
an informal introduction to symbolic logic.  
<p>

Section 6.2 covers positive logic.  Positive rulebases and goals are defined. 
The topics covered include the Herbrand universe for a rulebase, answer substitutions, 
interpretations and models, answers, minimal model, rule trees, Prolog computation, 
and extraction of proofs as rule trees.  The material in this section is a good 
company for the material in the popular book <i>Foundations of Logic Programming</i> by J.W. Lloyd (1984,1987).

<p>

Section 6.3 develops a nice Prolog translator from first-order logic into normal form 
logic rules.  The normal form rules serve as inputs to a normal form reasoning 
program in section 6.4.



<p>

Section 6.4 develops an interesting normal rulebase query interpreter for linear 
disjunctive logic.  The semantics for 
normal rulebases is based upon states and rule trees.  Rule trees were 
introduced in a simpler setting in Section 6.2, for positive rulebases.  The 
design and implementation of a normal 
rulebase query interpreter is developed in Prolog.

<p>
Section 6.5 discusses some of the issues regarding soundness and completeness of 
the normal rulebase interpreter developed in Section 6.4.  The use of a <i>tabeled</i>
Prolog (such as XSB Prolog) is discussed briefly.  
<p>
Section 6.6 presents a Java visualization tool for displaying the ruletrees
generated by the normal rulebase interpreter of Section 6.4. Other material regarding
<i>visual logic</i>, including Luu Tran's thesis (c.1996), can be found by clicking

<p>
Recently (c. 2005), <i>finitary geometric logic</i> (aka <i>coherent logic</i>) seems to be an interesting alternative to linear 
disjunctive logic.  Please see <a href="http://johnrfisher.net/geolog/" target="_blank"> <i><b>Geolog and Skolem Machines</b></i> </a> for 
some web notes focusing on Prolog implementations of geometric logic (opens in separate window).
