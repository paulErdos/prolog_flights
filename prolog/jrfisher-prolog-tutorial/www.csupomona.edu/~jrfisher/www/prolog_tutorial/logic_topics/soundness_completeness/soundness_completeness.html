<h2>
6.5 Evidentiary soundness and completeness of the meta-interpreter
</h2>


Reread the definition of an <a href="../npl/npl.html#evident">evident answer</a>
based on clause trees in the previous section.
The concept of an evident answer for a normal program is really a semantic
concept. The abstract tree-based definition itself is something quite separate
from any algorithm or program that is intended to compute evident answers
for normal programs. Of course, we intend that the npl program <i>should</i>
compute evident answers.
<p>In general, we are interested in two properties of logic meta-interpreters
for normal programs.
<ul>
<li>
evidentiary soundness</li>

<li>
evidentiary completeness</li>
</ul>
The first property is called <i>evidentiary soundness</i> or <i>correctness</i>.
This means that answers produced by the logic meta-interpreter must be
evident answers as defined using the clause trees in the previous section.
<p>If an answer produced by npl has free variables in it then the correctness
of such an answer means that each grounding of those variables produces
an evident answer for the goal.
<p><i>Example.</i> Consider the normal program
<blockquote>
<pre>
p(a).
q(b).
</pre>
</blockquote>
and the npl goal
<blockquote>
<pre>?- why(p(X)|p(Y)).

|-- p(a) | P(G680)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- p(a)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- true

Y = G680
X = a</pre>
</blockquote>
The answer substitution s = {X/a,Y/G680} is considered as correct, but
it should be taken as meaning that Y could be any value in <b>domain</b>(P)
= {a,b}.
<p>We could have originally given a (more complicated) definition for an
evident answer substitution that allowed free variables.
<p>Meta-interpreters like npl can be counted on as having evidentiary correctness
because these meta-interpreters are designed to actually construct the
required clause trees.
<p><b><i>Exercise 1.</i></b> Argue informally, using careful inspection
of the source code for npl, that if and when npl has finished computing
an answer it has actually constructed a bonafide clause tree and therefore
computed an evident answer (provided free variables in npl's answers are
considered appropriately, as mentioned above). The specification to inspect
is that given previously for <tt>ctie </tt>(the clause tree inference engine),
which was designed to grow these trees incrementally.
<p>Notice carefully that evidentiary soundness is different than the usual
concept of <i>logical soundness</i>, which would require that the answers
computed should be logical consequences of the program. Logical soundness
of the meta-interpreter is a concept that would really only make sense
if the normal program is known to be consistent.
<p><b><i>Exercise 2.</i></b> Show that evidentiary correctness implies
logical soundness. Give some sample programs to show that evidentiary correctness
is a strictly stronger condition than logical soundness. What kind of programs
do these examples have to be?
<p>The second important property for a normal logic meta-interpreter is
called <i>evidentiary completeness</i>. There are varying degrees of evidentiary
completness. As an <i>acceptor </i>(Yes/No) algorithm the meta-interpreter
should say Yes when given a ground normal goal <tt>G </tt>for which there
exists a closed clause tree rooted at <tt>G</tt>; and otherwise the meta-interpreter
should answer No. For the npl meta-interpreter this means that the Prolog
goal <tt>npl(G)</tt> would yield yes in the former case, No in the latter.
<p>As an answer <i>generator</i>,<i> </i>varying degrees of completeness
would result depending on how many answers the meta-interpreter would give
for normal goals with variables. The best that one can hope for is that
the meta-interpreter would find all possible values for the variables in
the goal.
<p>A normal program is <i>recursive </i>if the collection of contrapositive
clauses <b>contra</b>(P) is recursive.
<p><b><i>Exercise 3.</i></b> Give a formal definition of a recursive normal
program, with all of the details. This takes some careful formulation even
though the concept is fairly straightforward. (Hint: You know what a recursive
Prolog program is, even though it has not be formally defined in the tutorial!)
<p><b><i>Exercise 4.</i></b> Show, using a variety of examples of nonrecursive
normal programs, that npl can generate all possible answers, but that,
even when it does, it still might generate many repeated answers. Use Prolog
goals like <tt>?- bagof(answer_list, npl(G), S)</tt> where <tt>answer_list
</tt>is
a list of the variables in <tt>G</tt>; e.g., if <tt>G </tt>is<tt> p(X,Y)</tt>
then answer_list would be <tt>[X,Y]</tt>.
<p>However, normal programs with recursion can cause uncontrolled looping,
and consequent nonterminating behavior for the meta-interpreter.
<p>Here is a simple normal program that can give npl a lot of trouble.
The student should follow along by trying all of the sample executions.
<p><b><i>Example P3.</i></b> Suppose that we have a little road map with
towns
<tt>a</tt>,<tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt>, and connecting roads <tt>1</tt>,<tt>2</tt>,
and <tt>3</tt>.
<center>
<p><img SRC="f6_3_1.gif" height=120 width=106 ALT="road map"></center>

<p>Suppose that roads connecting towns are either ok to travel or not.
Consider the normal program
<blockquote>
<pre>connects(a,b,1).
connects(b,a,1).
connects(b,c,2).
connects(c,b,2).
connects(a,c,3).
connects(c,a,3).

ok(1) | ok(2).
ok(3).

go(X,Y) :- connects(X,Y,R), ok(R).
go(X,Z) :- connects(X,Y,R), ok(R), go(Y,Z).</pre>
</blockquote>
Read the 7th clause as intending to say that <i>at least one of</i> road
<tt>1</tt>
or road <tt>2</tt> is <tt>ok</tt>. The 9th and 10th clause give a familiar
looking declaration for being able to <tt>go</tt> from one town to another.
Load P3 into npl and try some goals...
<blockquote>
<pre>?- [npl].
...
?- know('p3.npl'). %%% The file holding P3&nbsp;

?- why(go(a,b)).

|-- go(a, b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- connects(a, b, 1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- ok(1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- ~ ok(2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- ~ go(c, b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- ~ go(a, b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- ancestor resolution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- connects(a, c, 3)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- ok(3)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- connects(c, b, 2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |-- true

?- why(go(b,a)).
...</pre>
</blockquote>
The second goal given will not terminate. The npl meta-interpreter trys
to match goals left-to-right (like Prolog). An examination of <b>contra</b>(P3)
will help indicate why. In particular, note that the contrapositive
<blockquote>
<pre>~go(A, B) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~go(C, B),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connects(C, A, D),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ok(D).</pre>
</blockquote>
is left-recursive (without first binding C). Also, the contrapositive
<blockquote>
<pre>~ok(A) :-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~go(B, C),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connects(B, D, A),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go(D, C).</pre>
</blockquote>
introduces new variables in the body that would not have been bound in
the head.
<p><b><i>Exercise 5.</i></b> Draw a diagram to trace how npl tries to construct
a clause tree having root <tt>go(b,a)</tt>. (Prolog's trace may be of some
help.) Try to show how the left-recursiveness and the late binding cause
looping.
<p>As example P3 shows, it is easy to create simple, interesting normal
programs for which npl, or any similar meta-interpreter, will be <i>computationally
incomplete</i>: That is, the meta-interpreter will not be able to confirm
or generate all possible evident answers. Various methods can be used to
pry out answers, such as grounding and reordering of goals, as illustrated
for P3.
<p>One can modify contra(P3) to try to aleviate the problems that we have
mentioned. To save a file for <b>contra</b>(P3), use the following ...
<blockquote>
<pre>?- [npl].
&nbsp;...
?- know('p3.npl').
Yes
?- tell('p3.c'), show, told.
...</pre>
</blockquote>
The last goal will write the clauses in <b>contra</b>(P3) to the file 'p3.c',
where we have used extension 'c' to indicate "contrapositives".
<p>Now edit the file p3.c to effect the following changes ...
<blockquote>
<tt>

</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~go(C, B),    <br>

</blockquote>
The edit changes have been highlighted in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>.
Save this file as p3.crg, the 'r' for reordering and the 'g' for "grounding".
<p>Note that we have informally introduced two <i>static proof strategies</i>.
They are "static" because one simply modifies the normal program given
to the meta-interpreter rather than modify the meta-interpreter itself
(see below). The <i>reordering strategy</i> reorders subgoals in the bodies
of clauses in <b>contra</b>(P).. The <i>grounding strategy</i> forces grounding
explicitly before a subgoal is attempted. As in our example, these two
strategies are closely related. Both strategies, in effect, try to delay
a goal until after more of its variables have been bound. This avoids the
generation of more and more subgoals with new variables.
<p><b><i>Exercise 6.</i></b> Argue informally that the modified <b>contra</b>(P3)
(red changes) and the original <b>contra</b>(P) can be used to make exactly
the same clause trees, and hence produce exactly the same evident answers,
except for what? That is, what goals for the modified <b>contra</b>(P)
have answers that the original did not? and why?
<p><b>Note:&nbsp; The following experiment was originally performed using
SWI Prolog (which automatically loads clauses dynamically).&nbsp; This
will not work without modification using the XSB system.</b>
<p>To use the modified <b>contra</b>(P3) rather than those generated using
<tt>know('p3.npl')</tt>,
restart npl (or be sure to <tt>forget </tt>p3.npl) and use an ordinary
Prolog load to load the modified contrapositves in
<b>contra</b>(P3) ...
<blockquote><tt>?- ['p3.cg'].</tt></blockquote>
The looping for <tt>go </tt>goals is eliminated by the modifications we
have made. Be sure to do the following exercise.
<p><b><i>Exercise 7.</i></b> Using p3.cg as above, try all of the goals
<tt>why(go(a,b))</tt>,
<tt>why(go(b,a))</tt>,
<tt>why(go(b,c))</tt>,
<tt>why(go(c,c))</tt>,
etc. Show that npl can confirm all of these ground goals. How about generating
all answers with a goal like <tt>npl(go(X,Y))</tt> or <tt>why(go(X,Y))</tt>?
<p><i><b>Exercise 8.</b> </i>Make necessary modifications so that this
experiment can be performed using the XSB system.
<p><i><b>Exercise 9. (Project)</b>&nbsp; </i>Explore using XSB's
<i>tabling</i>
mechanism to avoid loops in npl.&nbsp; Is there any way to use tabling
to also reimplement npl's ancestry resolution?  Click the following link 
for the XSB homepage ...

<p>
Other approach to avoiding loops could result from modifing the meta-interpreter
npl itself. This gives various <i>dynamic strategies,</i> so called because
they come into play while the meta-interpreter in executing. Another version
of npl could dynamically reorder subgoals. This is, however, very hard
to implement, and we do <b>not</b> pursue this here.
<p>Another dynamic kind of strategy that come from the field of mechanical
theorem proving is called a <i>subsumption strategy</i>. One simple goal
<tt>G1
</tt><i>subsumes</i>
another simple goal <tt>G2 </tt>provided that
<tt>G2
</tt>is an instance
of <tt>G1</tt>. This means that some substitution (possibly empty) must
be applied to <tt>G2 </tt>in order to produce <tt>G1</tt>. The dynamic
<i>forward
subsumption</i> strategy avoids continuing with goals that are subsumed
by an ancestor, and the <i>backward subsumption</i> strategy avoids continuing
with goals that subsume some ancestor. For npl, to avoid continuing would
mean to <b>fail</b> the goal in question, and thus continue with some other
alternatives or choices. (In general, the actual control mechanism depends
on the details of the design of the meta-interpreter.) Both of these strategies
sometimes produce more, or new, answers, compared to what could be computed
without the strategies in force. <b>But </b>both strategies are known to
sometimes prevent the computation of answers that were possible without
the strategies being in force.
<p><b><i>Exercise 10. (Project)</i></b>&nbsp; Implement subsumption, and
add it as a feature of npl. One must be careful that the subsumption test
does <b>not bind variables</b> in the subgoal. Make it so that subsumption
can be turned on or turned off before an npl query. Use the modified npl
program on some recursive programs to get answers not possible without
subsumption. On the other hand, show that subsumption can block getting
some answers for some programs.
<p>Are there programs for which npl would be complete? Yes...
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER BGCOLOR="#80FFFF" >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=MIDDLE>The meta-interpreter npl will be complete,
both as an acceptor and as a generator for <b>nonrecursive</b> normal programs.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b><i>Exercise 11.</i></b> Argue informally that the result displayed
above is correct. Actually, how deep can a clause tree for a nonrecursive
normal program be?
<p>Nonrecursiveness is a very severe restriction, and completeness will
obtain for many kinds of recursive programs also. We do not pursue details
here. But it would be impossible to obtain a general completeness result
for logic meta-interpreters. A general completeness result for meta-interpreters
for normal programs would imply a general decision procedure for all computation,
which the student may know can be proved <b>not </b>to be possible.
