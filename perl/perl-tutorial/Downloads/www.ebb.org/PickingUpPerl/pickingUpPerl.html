<h2>Purpose of this Book</h2>

<p>This book has been created for a number of reasons.  The primary reason
is to provide a freely redistributable tutorial for the Perl language. 
In writing this freely redistributable tutorial, it is our hope that the
largest number of people can have access to it and share it.

<p>In the Perl community, we have discovered ways to save time by writing
Perl programs that make our jobs and lives easier.  Surely, Perl is not
a panacea, but it has certainly made our lives a little bit better.  It
is hoped that you can use Perl to make your jobs and lives easier, too.

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>This book does not that assume any prior knowledge of Perl.  However, a
reader familiar with standard computer science concepts such as
abstraction, stacks, queues, and hash tables will definitely find
her<a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  way through this book with
ease. In other words, anyone with a knowledge equivalent to a first-year
of college computer science courses should find this book very basic. 
Those of less experience may find this book challenging.

<h2>Material Covered</h2>

<p>The material covered in this book is designed to prepare the reader to
enter the world of Perl programming.  This book covers the basic data
and control structures of Perl, as well as the philosophies behind Perl
programming.  The native search patterns used in Perl, called regular
expressions, are introduced and discussed.

<p>These concepts are introduced through the use of examples.  It is hoped
that readers find these examples fun.

<h2>Conventions Used in this Book</h2>

<p>In this text, a variety of conventions are used to explain the material. 
Certain typographical and display elements are used for didactic
purposes.

<p>Any Perl code that is included directly in flowing text appears like
this: <code>$x = 5</code>.  Any operating system commands discussed in flowing
text appear like this: <code>program</code>.  Operating system files that
are discussed directly in the flowing text appear like this:
<code>file</code>.  When a technical term of particular importance is first
introduced and explained, it appears in emphasized text, like this:
<dfn>an important term</dfn>.

<p>When Perl code examples or operating system commands need to be separated
away from the flowing text for emphasis, or because the code is long, it
appears like this:

<pre>my $x = "foo";     # This is a Perl assignment
print $x, "\n";    # Print out "foo" and newline
</pre>

<p>All Perl code shown in this manner will be valid in Perl, version
<code>5.6.0</code>.  In most cases, you can paste code from one of
these sections into a Perl program, and the code should work, even under
<code>use strict</code> and <code>use warnings</code>.

<p>Sometimes, it will be necessary to include code that is not valid Perl. 
In this case, a comment will appear right after the invalid statement
indicating that it is not valid, like this:

<pre>$x = "foo;     # INVALID: a <code>"</code> character is missing
</pre>

<p>When code that we set aside forms an entire Perl program that is
self-contained, and not simply a long example code section, it will
appear like this:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;

print "Hello World\n";
</pre>

<p>Finally, when text is given as possible output that might be given as
error messages when <code>perl</code> is run, they will appear like this:
<pre>Semicolon seems to be missing
syntax error
</pre>

<p>Keep these standards in mind as you read this book.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>This chapter begins the introduction to Perl by giving a simple code
example.  We do not expect the reader to understand this example
completely (yet).  We present this example to ease the reader into
Perl's syntax and semantics.

<h2>A First Perl Program</h2>

<p>So, to begin our study of Perl, let us consider a small Perl program. 
Do not worry that you are not familiar with all the syntax used here. 
The syntax will be introduced more formally as we continue on through
this book.  Just try to infer the behavior of the constructs below as
best you can.

<p>For our first Perl program, we will ask the user their username, and
print out a message greeting the user by name.

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;                        # important pragma
use warnings;                      # another important pragma
print "What is your username?  ";  # print out the question
my $username;                      # "declare" the variable
$username = &lt;STDIN&gt;;               # ask for the username
chomp($username);                  # remove "new line"
print "Hello, $username.\n";       # print out the greeting

# Now we have said hello to our user
</pre>

<p>Let us examine this program line by line to ascertain its meaning.  Some
hand-waving will be necessary, since some of the concepts will not be
presented until later.  However, this code is simple enough that you need
not yet understand completely what each line is doing.

<p>The first line is how the program is identified as a Perl program.  All
Perl programs should start with a line like <code>#!/<var>path</var>/perl</code>. 
Usually, it is just <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code>.  You should put this line at
the top of each of your Perl programs.

<p>In the lines that follow, halfway through each line, there is a <code>#</code>
character.  Everything from the <code>#</code> character until the end of the
line is considered a <dfn>comment</dfn>.  You are not required to comment
each line.  In fact, commenting each line is rare.  However, you will
find in this text that we frequently put comments on every line, since
we are trying to explain to the reader exactly what each Perl statement
is doing.  When you write Perl programs, you should provide comments,
but you need not do so as verbosely as we do in this text.

<p>Note, too, that comments can also occur on lines by themselves.  The
last line of the program above is an example of that.

<p>Now, consider the code itself, ignoring everything that follows a
<code>#</code> character.  Notice that each line (ignoring comments) ends with
a <code>;</code>.  This is the way that you tell Perl that a <dfn>statement</dfn>
is complete.  We'll talk more about statements soon; for now, just
consider a statement to be a single, logical command that you give to
Perl.

<p>The first line, <code>use strict</code>, is called a <dfn>pragma</dfn> in Perl.  It
is not something that "explicitly" gets executed, from your point of
view as the programmer.  Instead, a pragma specifies (or changes) the
rules that Perl uses to understand the code that follows.  The <code>use
strict;</code> pragma enforces the strictest possible rules for compiling the
code.  You should always use this pragma while you are still new to
Perl, as it will help you find the errors in your code more easily.

<p>The second line is another pragma, <code>use warnings</code>.  This pragma
tells Perl that you'd like to be warned as much as possible when you
write code that might be questionable.  Certain features of Perl can
confuse new (and sometimes even seasoned) Perl programmers.  The
<code>use warnings</code> pragma, like <code>use strict</code>, is a way to tell
Perl that you'd like to be warned at run-time when certain operations
seem questionable.

<p>So, you might wonder why two separate pragmas are needed.  The reason is
that they are enforced by Perl at different times.  The <code>use
strict</code> pragma enforces compile-time constraints on the program source
code.  You can even test them without running the program by using
<code>perl -c <var>filename</var></code>, where <var>filename</var> is the file
containing your program.  That option does not run your program, it
merely checks that they syntax of your program is correct.  (To remember
this, remember that the letter <code>c</code> in <code>-c</code> stands for
"check the program".)

<p>By contrast, the <code>use warnings</code> pragma controls run-time
behavior.  With <code>use warnings</code>, messages could be printed while
your program runs, if Perl notices something wrong.  In addition,
different inputs to the program can cause different messages to be
printed (or suppress such messages entirely).

<p>The third line is the first statement of the program the performs an
action directly.  It is a call to Perl's built-in <code>print</code>
function.  In this case, it is taking a string (enclosed in double
quotes) as its argument, and sending that string to the standard output,
which is, by default, the terminal, window, or console from which the
program is run.

<p>The next line is a variable <dfn>declaration</dfn>.  When in <code>strict</code>
mode (set by the <code>use strict</code> pragma), all variables must be
declared.  In this case, Perl's <code>my</code> keyword is used to declare
the variable <code>$username</code>.  A variable like <code>$username</code>
that starts with a <code>$</code> is said to be a <dfn>scalar</dfn> variable.  For
more information on scalar variables, see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Working%20with%20Scalars">Working with Scalars</a>. 
For now, just be aware that scalar variables can hold strings.

<p>The next line, <code>$username = &lt;STDIN&gt;</code> is an assignment statement,
which is denoted by the <code>=</code>.  The left hand side of the assignment
is that scalar variable, <code>$username</code>, that we declared in the line
before it.  Since <code>$username</code> is on the left hand side of the
<code>=</code>, that indicates <code>$username</code> will be assigned a new value
by this assignment statement.

<p>The right hand side of the assignment is a construct that allows us to
get input from the keyboard, the default standard input.  <code>STDIN</code>
is called a <dfn>file handle</dfn> that represents the standard input.  We
will discuss more about file handles later.  For now, just remember that
the construct <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code>, when assigned to a scalar variable, places
the next line of standard input into that scalar variable.

<p>Thus, at this point, we have the next line of the input (which is
hopefully the username that we asked for), in the <code>$username</code>
variable.  Since we got the contents of <code>$username</code> from the
standard input, we know that the user hit return after typing her
username.  The return key inserts a special character, called newline,
at the end of the line.  The <code>$username</code> variable contains the
full contents of the line, which is not just the user's name, but also
that newline character.

<p>To take care of this, the next thing we do is <code>chomp($username)</code>. 
Perl's built-in function, <code>chomp</code>, removes any newline characters
that are on the end of a variable.  So, after the <code>chomp</code>
operation, the variable <code>$username</code>

<p>The final statement is another <code>print</code> statement.  It uses the
value of the <code>$username</code> variable to greet the user with her
name.  Note that it is acceptable to use <code>$username</code> inside of
the string to be printed, and the contents of that scalar are included.

<p>This ends our discussion of our small Perl program.  Now that you have
some idea of what Perl programs look like, we can begin to look at Perl,
its data types, and its constructs in detail.

<h2>Expressions, Statements, and Side-Effects</h2>

<p>Before we begin introduce more Perl code examples, we want to explain
the ideas of an <dfn>expression</dfn> and a <dfn>statement</dfn>, and how each
looks in Perl.

<p>Any valid "chunk" of Perl code can be considered an <dfn>expression</dfn>. 
That expression always evaluates to some value.  Sometimes, the value to
which expression evaluates is of interest to us, and sometimes it is
not.  However, we always must be aware that each expression has some
"value" that is the evaluation of that expression.

<p>Zero or more expressions to make a <em>statement</em> in Perl.  Statements
in Perl end with a semi-colon.  For example, in the Perl code we saw
before, we turned the expression, <code>chomp($userName)</code>, into a
statement, <code>chomp($userName);</code> by adding a <code>;</code> to the end.  If
it helps, you can think about the <code>;</code>s as separating sets of
expressions that you want Perl to evaluate and execute in order.

<p>Given that every expression, even when combined into statements,
evaluate to some value, you might be tempted to ask: What does the
expression <code>chomp($userName)</code> evaluate to?  It turns out that
expression evaluates to the total number of characters removed from the
end of the variable <code>$userName</code>.  This is actually one of those
cases where we are not particularly interested in the evaluation result
of the code.  In this case, we were instead interested in what is called
the <dfn>side-effect</dfn> of the expression.

<p>The <dfn>side-effect</dfn> of an expression is some change that occurs as a
result of that expression's evaluation.  Often, a side-effect causes
some change in the state of the running program, such as changing the
value of a variable.  In the expression <code>chomp($userName)</code>, the
side-effect is that any newline characters are removed from the end of
the variable, <code>$username</code>.

<p>Let's now consider a slightly more complex statement, and look for the
the expressions and side-effect.  Consider the statement,
<code>$username = &lt;STDIN&gt;;</code> from our first program.  In this case, we
used the expression, <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code> as part of a larger expression,
namely <code>$username = &lt;STDIN&gt;</code>.  The expression, <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code>
evaluated to a scalar value, namely a string that represented a line
from the standard input.  It was of particular interest to us the value
to which <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code> evaluated, because we wanted to save that value
in the variable, <code>$username</code>.

<p>To cause that assignment to take place, we used the larger expression,
<code>$username = &lt;STDIN&gt;</code>.  The side-effect of that larger expression
is that <code>$username</code> contains the value that <code>&lt;STDIN&gt;</code>
evaluated to.  That side-effect is what we wanted in this case, and we
ignore the value to which <code>$username = &lt;STDIN&gt;</code> evaluates.  (It
turns out that it evaluates to the value contained in <code>$username</code>
after the assignment took place.)

<p>The concepts of statements, expressions and side-effects will become
more clear as we continue.  When appropriate, we'll point out various
expression and discuss what they evaluate to, and indicate what
side-effects are of interest to us.

<h1>Working with Scalars</h1>

<p>Scalar data are the most basic in Perl.  Each scalar datum is logically
a single entity.  Scalars can be strings of characters or numbers.  In
Perl, you write literal scalar strings like this:

<p>For example, the strings <code>"foobar"</code> and <code>'baz'</code> are scalar
data.  The numbers <code>3</code>, <code>3.5</code> and <code>-1</code> are also scalar
data.

<p>Strings are always enclosed in some sort of quoting, the most common of
which are single quotes, <code>''</code>, and and double quotes, <code>""</code>. 
We'll talk later about how these differ, but for now, you can keep in
mind that any string of characters inside either type of quotes are
scalar string data.

<p>Numbers are always written without quotes.  Any numeric sequence without
quotes are scalar number data.

<p>In this chapter, we will take a look at the variety of scalar data
available in Perl, the way to store them in variables, how to operate on
them, and how to output them.

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>Any sequence of <small>ASCII</small> characters put together as one unit, is
a string.  So, the word <code>the</code> is a string.  This sentence is a
string.  Even this entire paragraph is a string.  In fact, you could
consider the text of this entire book as one string.

<p>Strings can be of any length and can contain any characters, numbers,
punctuation, special characters (like <code>!</code>, <code>#</code>, and <code>%</code>),
and even characters in natural languages besides English In addition, a
string can contain special <small>ASCII</small> formatting characters like
newline, tab, and the "bell" character.  We will discuss special
characters more later on.  For now, we will begin our consideration of
strings by considering how to insert literal strings into a Perl
program.

<p>To begin our discussion of strings in Perl, we will consider how to work
with "string literals" in Perl.  The word <dfn>literal</dfn> here refers
to the fact that these are used when you want to type a string directly
to Perl.  This can be contrasted with storing a string in a
<dfn>variable</dfn>.

<p>Any string literal can be used as an expression.  We will find this
useful when we want to store string literals in variables.  However, for
now, we will simply consider the different types of string literals that
one can make in Perl.  Later, we will learn how to assign these string
literals to variables (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Scalar%20Variables">Scalar Variables</a>).

<h3>Single-quoted Strings</h3>

<p>String literals can be represented in primarily three ways in Perl.  The
first way is in single quotes.  Single quotes can be used to make sure
that nearly all special characters that might be interpreted differently
are taken at "face value".  If that concept is confusing to you, just
think about single quoted strings as being, for the most part, "what
you see is what you get".  Consider the following single-quoted string:

<pre>'i\o';  # The string 'i\o'
</pre>

<p>This represents a string consisting of the character <code>i</code>, followed
by <code>\</code>, followed by <code>o</code>. However, it is probably easier just
to think of the string as <code>i\o</code>.  Some other languages require
you think of strings not as single chunks of data, but as some
aggregation of a set of characters.  Perl does not work this way.  A
string is a simple, single unit that can be as long as you would
like.<a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p>Note in our example above that <code>'i\o'</code> is an expression.  Like all
expressions, it evaluates to something.  In this case, it evaluates to
the string value, <code>i\o</code>.  Note that we made the expression
<code>'i\o'</code> into a statement, by putting a semi-colon at the end
(<code>'i\o'</code>;).  This particular statement does not actually perform any
action in Perl, but it is still a valid Perl statement nonetheless.

<h4>Special Characters in Single-quoted Strings</h4>

<p>There are two characters in single quoted strings that do not always
represent themselves.  This is due to necessity, since single-quoted
strings start and end with the <code>'</code> character.  We need a way to
express inside a single-quoted string that we want the string to contain
a <code>'</code> character.

<p>The solution to this problem is to preceded any <code>'</code> characters we
actually want to appear in the string itself with the backslash
(<code>\</code> character).  Thus we have strings like this:
<pre>'xxx\'xxx';  # xxx, a single-quote character, and then xxx
</pre>

<p>We have in this example a string with 7 characters exactly.  Namely,
this is the string: <code>xxx'xxx</code>.  It can be difficult at first to
become accustomed to the idea that two characters in the input to Perl
actually produce only one character in the string itself.  <a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-3"><sup>3</sup></a>  However, just keep
in mind the rules and you will probably get used to them quickly.

<p>Since we have used the <code>\</code> character to do something special with
the <code>'</code> character, we must now worry about the special cases for
the backslash character itself.  When we see a <code>\</code> character in a
single-quoted string, we must carefully consider what will happen.

<p>Under most circumstances, when a <code>\</code> is in a single-quoted string,
it is simply a backslash, representing itself, as most other characters
do.  However, the following exceptions apply:

<ul>
<li>The sequence <code>\'</code> yields the character <code>'</code> in the actual
      string.  (This is the exception we already discussed above).

<li>The sequence <code>\\</code> yields the character <code>\</code> in the actual
      string.  In other words, two backslashes right next to each other
      actually yield only one backslash.

<li>A backslash, by itself, cannot be placed at the end of a the
      single-quoted string.  This cannot happen because Perl will think
      that you are using the <code>\</code> to escape the closing <code>'</code>.

</ul>

<p>The following examples exemplify the various exceptions, and use them
properly:
<pre>'I don\'t think so.';          # Note the ' inside is escaped with \
'Need a \\ (backslash) or \?'; # The \\ gives us \, as does \
'You can do this: \\';         # A single backslash at the end
'Three \\\'s: "\\\\\"';        # There are three \ chars between ""
</pre>

<p>In the last example, note that the resulting string is
<code>Three \'s: "\\\"</code>.  If you can follow that example, you have
definitely mastered how single-quoted strings work!

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Single-quoted%20Strings">Single-quoted Strings</a>
<br>

<h4>Newlines in Single-quoted Strings</h4>

<p>Note that there is no rule against having a single-quoted string span
several lines.  When you do this, the string has <em>newline</em>
characters embedded in it.

<p>A newline character is a special ASCII character that indicates that a
new line should be started.  In a text editor, or when printing output
to the screen, this usually indicates that the cursor should move from
the end of the current line to the first position on the line following
it.

<p>Since Perl permits the placement of these newline characters directly
into single quoted strings, we are permitted to do the following:

<pre>'Time to
start anew.';   # Represents the single string composed of:
                # 'Time to' followed by a newline, followed by
                # 'start anew.'
</pre>

<p>This string has a total of twenty characters.  The first seven are
<code>Time to</code>.  The next character following that is a newline.  Then,
the eleven characters, <code>start anew.</code> follow.  Note again that this
is <strong>one string</strong>, with a newline as its eighth character.

<p>Further, note that we are not permitted to put a comment in the middle
of the string, even though we are usually allowed to place a <code>#</code>
anywhere on the line and have the rest of the line be a comment.  We
cannot do this here, since we have yet to terminate our single-quoted
string with a <code>'</code>, and thus, any <code>#</code> character and comment
following it would actually become part of the single-quoted string! 
Remember that single-quotes strings are delimited by <code>'</code> at the
beginning, and <code>'</code> at the end, and everything in between is
considered part of the string, included newlines, <code>#</code> characters
and anything else.

<br>

<h4>Examples of Invalid Single-quoted Strings</h4>

<p>In finishing our discussion of singled-quoted strings, consider these
examples of strings that are <strong>not</strong> legal because they violate the
exceptions we talked about above:

<pre>'You cannot do this: \'; # INVALID: the ending \ cannot be alone
'It is 5 o'clock!'       # INVALID: the ' in o'clock should be escaped
'Three \'s: \\\\\';      # INVALID: the final \ escapes the ', thus
                         #          the literal is  not terminated
'This is my string;      # INVALID: missing close quote
</pre>

<p>Sometimes, when you have invalid string literals such as in the example
above, the error message that Perl gives is not particularly intuitive. 
However, when you see error messages such as:
<pre>(Might be a runaway multi-line '' string starting on line X)
Bareword found where operator expected
Bareword "foo" not allowed while "strict subs" in use
</pre>

<p>It is often an indication that you have runaway or invalid strings. 
Keep an eye out for these problems.  Chances are, you will forget and
violate one of the rules for single-quoted strings eventually, and then
need to determine why you are unable to run your Perl program.

<br>

<h3>A Digression--The print Function</h3>

<p>Before we move on to our consideration of double-quoted strings, it is
necessary to first consider a small digression.  We know how to
represent strings in Perl, but, as you may have noticed, the examples we
have given thus far do not do anything interesting.  If you try placing
the statements that we listed as examples in <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Single-quoted%20Strings">Single-quoted Strings</a>, into a full Perl program, like this:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

'Three \\\'s: "\\\\\"'; # There are three \ chars between ""
'xxx\'xxx';             # xxx, a single-quote character, and then xxx
'Time to
start anew.';
</pre>

<p>you probably noticed that nothing of interest happens.  Perl
gladly runs this program, but it produces no output.

<p>Thus, to begin to work with strings in Perl beyond simple hypothetical
considerations, we need a way to have Perl display our strings for us. 
The canonical way of accomplishing this in Perl is to use the
<code>print</code> function.

<p>The <code>print</code> function in Perl can be used in a variety of ways. 
The simplest form is to use the statement <code>print STRING;</code>, where
<code>STRING</code> is any valid Perl string.

<p>So, to reconsider our examples, instead of simply listing the strings,
we could instead print each one out:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print 'Three \\\'s: "\\\\\"'; # Print first string
print 'xxx\'xxx';             # Print the second
print 'Time to
start anew.
';    # Print last string, with a newline at the end
</pre>

<p>This program will produce output.  When run, the output goes to what is
called the <dfn>standard output</dfn>.  This is usually the terminal, console
or window in which you run the Perl program.  In the case of the program
above, the output to the standard output is as follows:

<pre>Three \'s: "\\\"xxx'xxxTime to
start anew.
</pre>

<p>Note that a newline is required to break up the lines.  Thus, you need
to put a newline at the end of every valid string if you want your
string to be the last thing on that line in the output.

<p>Note that it is particularly important to put a newline on the end of
the last string of your output.  If you do not, often times, the command
prompt for the command interpreter that you are using may run together
with your last line of output, and this can be very disorienting.  So,
<strong>always</strong> remember to place a newline at the end of each line,
particularly on your last line of output.

<p>Finally, you may have noticed that formatting your code with newlines in
the middle of single-quoted strings hurts readability.  Since you are
inside a single-quoted string, you cannot change the format of the
continued lines within the print statement, nor put comments at the ends
of those lines because that would insert data into your single-quoted
strings.  To handle newlines more elegantly, you should use
double-quoted strings, which are the topic of the next section.

<br>

<h3>Double-quoted Strings</h3>

<p>Double-quoted strings are another way of representing scalar string
literals in Perl.  Like single-quoted strings, you place a group of
<small>ASCII</small> characters between two delimiters (in this case, our
delimiter is <code>"</code>).  However, something called <dfn>interpolation</dfn>
happens when you use a double-quoted string.

<h4>Interpolation in Double-quoted Strings</h4>

<p>Interpolation is a special process whereby certain special strings
written in <small>ASCII</small> are replaced by something different.  In
<a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Single-quoted%20Strings">Single-quoted Strings</a>, we noted that certain sequences in
single-quoted strings (namely, <code>\\</code> and <code>\'</code>) were treated
differently.  This is very similar to what happens with interpolation. 
For example, in interpolated double-quoted strings, various sequences
preceded by a <code>\</code> character act different.

<p>Here is a chart of the most common of these:

<p><table><tr align="left"><td><strong>String</strong> <td><strong>Interpolated As</strong>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>\\</code>       <td>an actual, single backslash character
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>\$</code>       <td>a single $ character
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>\@</code>      <td>a single @ character
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>\t</code>       <td>tab

<br></tr></table>

<h4>Examples of Interpolation</h4>

<p>Let us consider an example that uses a few of these characters:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print "A backslash: \\\n";
print "Tab follows:\tover here\n";
print "Ring! \a\n";
print "Please pay bkuhn\@ebb.org \$20.\n";
</pre>

<p>This program, when run, produces the following output on the screen:

<pre>A backslash: \
Tab follows:	over here
Ring!
Please pay bkuhn@ebb.org $20.
</pre>

<p>In addition, when running, you should hear the computer beep.  That is
the output of the <code>\a</code> character, which you cannot see on the
screen.  However, you should be able to hear it.

<p>Notice that the <code>\n</code> character ends a line.  <code>\n</code> should
always be used to end a line.  Those students familiar with the C
language will be used to using this sequence to mean <dfn>newline</dfn>. 
When writing Perl, the word <dfn>newline</dfn> and the <code>\n</code> character
are roughly synonymous.

<br>

<h4>Examples of Interpolation (ASCII Octal Values)</h4>

<p>With the exception of <code>\n</code>, you should note that the interpolated
sequences are simply shortcuts for actually <small>ASCII</small> characters
that can be expressed in other ways.  Specifically, you are permitted to
use the actual <small>ASCII</small> codes (in octal or hexadecimal) to
represent characters.  To exemplify this, consider the following
program:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print "A backslash: \134\n";
print "Tab follows:\11over here\n";
print "Ring! \7\n";
print "Please pay bkuhn\100ebb.org \04420.\n";
</pre>

<p>This program generates exactly the same output as the program we first
discussed in this section.  However, instead of using the so-called
"shortcuts" for the <small>ASCII</small> values, we wrote each character in
question using the octal value of that character.  Comparing the two
programs should provide some insight into the use of octal values in
double-quoted strings.

<p>Basically, you simply write <code>\XYZ</code>, where <var>XYZ</var> is the octal
number of the <small>ASCII</small> character desired.  Note that you don't
always need to write all three digits.  Namely, notice that the
double-quoted string, <code>"Ring! \7\n"</code>, did not require all the
digits.  This is because in the string, the octal value is immediately
followed by another <code>\</code>, and thus Perl could figure out what we
meant.  This is one of the many cases where you see Perl trying to "do
the right thing" when you do something that is technically not
completely legal.

<p>However, note that, in the last string, the three digits are required
for the sequence (<code>"\04420"</code>), because the <code>20</code> immediately
following the octal code could be easily confused with the octal value
preceding it.  The point, however, is that as long as you obey the rules
for doing so, you can often add characters to your double-quoted strings
by simply using the <small>ASCII</small> value.

<h4>Examples of Interpolation (ASCII Hex Values)</h4>

<p>You need not use only the octal values when interpolating
<small>ASCII</small> characters into double-quoted strings.  You can also use
the hexadecimal values.  Here is our same program using the hexadecimal
values this time instead of the octal values:

<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print "A backslash: \x5C\n";
print "Tab follows:\x09over here\n";
print "Ring! \x07\n";
print "Please pay bkuhn\x40ebb.org \x2420.\n";
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the theme of "there's more than one way to do it" is
really playing out here.  However, we only used the <small>ASCII</small> codes as a
didactic exercise.  Usually, you should use the single character
sequences (like <code>\a</code> and <code>\t</code>), unless, of course, you are
including an <small>ASCII</small> character that does not have a shortcut, single
character sequence.

<h4>Characters Requiring Special Consideration</h4>

<p>The final issue we have yet to address with double-quoted strings is the
use of <code>$</code> and <code>@</code>.  These two characters must always be
quoted.  The reason for this is not apparent now, but be sure to keep
this rule in mind until we learn why this is needed.  For now, it is
enough to remember that in double-quoted strings, Perl does something
special with <code>$</code> and <code>@</code>, and thus we must be careful to
quote them.  (If you cannot wait to find out why, you should read

<h3>Numeric Literals</h3>

<p>Numeric literals are simply constant numbers.  Numeric literals are much
easier to comprehend and use than string literals.  There are only a few
basic ways to express numeric literals.

<p>The numeric literal representations that Perl users are similar to those
used in other languages such as C, Ada, and Pascal.  The following are a
few common examples:

<pre>42;         # The number 42
12.5;       # A floating point number, twelve and a half
101873.000; # 101,873
.005        # five thousandths
5E-3;       # same number as previous line
23e-100;    # 23 times 10 to the power of -100 (very small)
2.3E-99;    # The same number as the line above!
23e6;       # 23,000,000
23_000_000; # The same number as line above
            # The underscores are for readability only
</pre>

<p>As you can see, there are three basic ways to express numeric literals. 
The most simple way is to write an integer value, without a decimal
point, such as <code>42</code>.  This represents the number forty-two.

<p>You can also write numeric literals with a decimal point.  So, you can
write numbers like <code>12.5</code>, to represent numbers that are not
integral values.  If you like, you can write something like
<code>101873.000</code>, which really simply represents the integral value
101,873.  Perl does not mind that you put the extra 0's on the end.

<p>Probably the most complex method of expressing a numeric literal is
using what is called <dfn>exponential notation</dfn>.  These are numbers of
the form
b * 10^x
, where b is some decimal number, positive or negative, and
x is some integer, positive or negative.  Thus, you can express
very large numbers, or very small numbers that are mostly 0s
(either to the right or left of the decimal point) using this notation. 
However, when you write such a number as a literal in Perl, you must
write it in the from <code>bEx</code>, where <code>b</code> and <code>x</code> are the
desired base and exponent, but <code>E</code> is the actual character,
<code>E</code> (or <code>e</code>, if you prefer).  The examples of <code>5E-3</code>,
<code>23e-100</code>, <code>2.3E-99</code>, and <code>23e6</code> in the code above show
how the exponential notation can be used.

<p>Finally, if you write out a very large number, such as <code>23000000</code>,
you can place underscores inside the number to make it more
readable. <a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-5"><sup>5</sup></a>  Thus, <code>23000000</code> is exactly the
same as <code>23_000_000</code>.

<h4>Printing Numeric Literals</h4>

<p>As with string literals, you can also use the <code>print</code>
function in Perl to print numerical literals.  Consider this program:
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print 2E-4, ' ', 9.77E-5, " ", 100.00, " ", 10_181_973, ' ', 9.87E9,
      " ", 86.7E14, "\n";
</pre>
which produces the output:
<pre>0.0002 9.77e-05 100 10181973 9870000000 8.67e+15
</pre>

<p>First of all, we have done something new here with <code>print</code>. 
Instead of giving <code>print</code> one <dfn>argument</dfn>, we have given it a
number of arguments, separated by commas.  Arguments are simply the
parameters on which you wish the function to operate.  The <code>print</code>
function, of course, is used to display whatever arguments you give it.

<p>In this case, we gave a list of arguments that included both string and
numeric literals.  That is completely acceptable, since Perl can usually
tell the difference!  The string literals are simply spaces, which we
are using to separate our numeric literals on the output.  Finally, we
put the newline at the end of the output.

<p>Take a close look at the numeric literals that were output.  Notice that
Perl has made some formatting changes.  For example, as we know, the
<code>_</code>'s are removed from <code>10_181_973</code>.  Also, those decimals and
large integers in exponential notation that were relatively reasonable
to expand were expanded by Perl.  In addition, Perl only printed
<code>100</code> for <code>100.00</code>, since the decimal portion was zero.  Of
course, if you do not like the way that Perl formats numbers by default,
we will later learn a way to have Perl format them differently
(see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Output%20of%20Scalar%20Data">Output of Scalar Data</a>).

<br>

<h2>Scalar Variables</h2>

<p>Since we have now learned some useful concepts about strings and numbers
in Perl, we can consider how to store them in <dfn>variables</dfn>.  In
Perl, both numeric and string values are stored in <dfn>scalar
variables</dfn>.

<p>Scalar variables are storage areas that you can use to store any scalar
value.  As we have already discussed, scalar values are strings or
numbers, such as the literals that we discussed in previous sections.

<p>You can always identify scalar variables because they are in the form
<code>$NAME</code>, where <code>NAME</code> is any string of alphanumeric characters
and underscores starting with a letter, up to 255 characters total. 
Note that <code>NAME</code> will be <em>case sensitive</em>, thus <code>$xyz</code> is
a different variable than <code>$xYz</code>.

<p>Note that the first character in the name of any scalar variable must be
<code>$</code>.  All variables that begin with <code>$</code> are always scalar. 
Keep this in mind as you see various expressions in Perl.  You can
remember that anything that begins with <code>$</code> is always scalar.

<p>As we discussed (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#A%20First%20Perl%20Program">A First Perl Program</a>), it is best to always
declare variables with the <code>my</code> function.  You do not need to do
this if you are not using <code>strict</code>, but you should always use
<code>strict</code> until you are an experienced Perl programmer.

<p>The first operation we will consider with scalar variables is
<dfn>assignment</dfn>.  Assignment is the way that we give a value from some
scalar expression to a scalar variable.

<p>The assignment operator in Perl is <code>=</code>.  On the left hand side of
the <code>=</code>, we place the scalar variable whose value we wish to
change.  On the right side of the <code>=</code>, we place the scalar
expression.  (Note that so far, we have learned about three types of
scalar expressions: string literals, numeric literals, and scalar
variables).

<p>Consider the following code segment:
<pre>use strict;

my $stuff = "My data";  # Assigns "My data" to variable $stuff
$stuff = 3.5e-4;        # $stuff is no longer set to "My data";
                        # it is now 0.00035
my $things = $stuff;    # $things is now 0.00035, also.
</pre>

<p>Let us consider this code more closely.  The first line does two
operations.  First, using the <code>my</code> function, it declares the
variable <code>$stuff</code>.  Then, in the same statement, it assigns the
variable <code>$stuff</code> with the scalar expression, <code>"My data"</code>.

<p>The next line uses that same variable <code>$stuff</code>.  This time, it is
replacing the value of <code>"My data"</code> with the numeric value of
<code>0.00035</code>.  Note that it does not matter that <code>$stuff</code> once
contained string data.  We are permitted to change and assign it with a
different type of scalar data.

<p>Finally, we declare a new variable <code>$things</code> (again, using the
<code>my</code> function), and use assignment to give it the value of the
scalar expression <code>$stuff</code>.  What does the scalar expression,
<code>$stuff</code> evaluate to?  Simply, it evaluates to whatever scalar
value is held by <code>$stuff</code>.  In this case, that value is
<code>0.00035</code>.

<h3>Scalar Interpolation</h3>

<p>Recall that when we discussed double-quotes strings
(see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Double-quoted%20Strings">Double-quoted Strings</a>), we noted that we had to backslash the
<code>$</code> character (e.g., <code>"\$"</code>).  Now, we discuss the reason that
this was necessary.   Any scalar variable, when included in a
double-quoted string <dfn>interpolates</dfn>.

<p>Interpolation of scalar variables allows us to insert the value of a
scalar variable right into a double-quoted string.  In addition, since
Perl largely does all data conversion necessary, we can often use
variables that have integer and float values and interpolate them right
into strings without worry.  In most cases, Perl will do the right
thing.

<p>Consider the following sample code:
<pre>use strict;
my $friend = 'Joe';
my $greeting = "Howdy, $friend!";
            # $greeting contains "Howdy, Joe!"
my $cost = 20.52;
my $statement = "Please pay \$$cost.\n";
         # $statement contains "Please pay $20.52.\n"
my $debt = "$greeting  $statement";
         # $debt contains "Howdy, Joe!  Please pay $20.52.\n"
</pre>

<p>As you can see from this sample code, you can build up strings by
placing scalars inside double-quotes strings.  When the double-quoted
strings are evaluated, any scalar variables embedded within them are
replaced with the value that each variable holds.

<p>Note in our example that there was no problem interpolating
<code>$cost</code>, which held a numeric scalar value.  As we have discussed,
Perl tries to do the right thing when converting strings to numbers and
numbers to strings.  In this case, it simply converted the numeric value
of <code>20.52</code> into the string value <code>'20.52'</code> to interpolate
<code>$cost</code> into the double-quoted string.

<p>Interpolation is not only  used when assigning to other scalar
variables.  You can use a double-quoted string and interpolate it in any
context where a scalar expression is appropriate.  For example, we could
use it as part of the <code>print</code> statement.
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $owner  = 'Elizabeth';
my $dog    = 'Rex';
my $amount = 12.5;
my $what   = 'dog food';

print "${owner}'s dog, $dog, ate $amount pounds of $what.\n";
</pre>
This example produces the output:
<pre>Elizabeth's dog, Rex, ate 12.5 pounds of dog food.
</pre>

<p>Notice how we are able to build up a large string using four variables,
some text, and a newline character, all contained within one
interpolated double-quoted string.  We needed only to pass <strong>one
argument</strong> to <code>print</code>!  Recall that previously (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Printing%20Numeric%20Literals">Printing Numeric Literals</a>) we had to separate a number of scalar arguments by
commas to pass them to print.  Thus, using interpolation, it is very
easy to build up smaller scalars into larger, combined strings.  This is
a very convenient and frequently used feature of Perl.

<p>You may have noticed by now that we did something very odd with
<code>$owner</code> in the example above.  Instead of using <code>$owner</code>, we
used <code>${owner}</code>.  We were forced to do this because following a
scalar variable with the character <code>'</code> would confuse
Perl. <a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-6"><sup>6</sup></a> To make it
clear to Perl that we wanted to use the scalar with name <code>owner</code>,
we needed to enclose <code>owner</code> in curly braces (<code>{owner}</code>).

<p>In many cases when using interpolation, Perl requires us to do this. 
Certain characters that follow scalar variables mean something special
to Perl.  When in doubt, however, you can wrap the name of the scalar in
curly braces (as in <code>${owner}</code>) to make it clear to Perl what you
want.

<p>Note that this can also be a problem when an interpolated scalar
variable is followed by alpha-numeric text or an underscore.  This is
because Perl cannot tell where the name of the scalar variable ends and
where the literal text you want in the string begins.  In this case, you
also need to use the curly braces to make things clear.  Consider:
<pre>use strict;

my $this_data = "Something";
my $that_data = "Something Else ";

print "_$this_data_, or $that_datawill do\n"; # INVALID: actually refers
                                              # to the scalars $this_data_
                                              # and $that_datawill

print "_${this_data}_, or ${that_data}will do\n";
           # CORRECT: refers to $this_data and $that_data,
           #          using curly braces to make it clear
</pre>

<h3>Undefined Variables</h3>

<p>You may have begun to wonder: what value does a scalar variable have if
you have not given it a value?  In other words, after:

<pre>use strict;
my $sweetNothing;
</pre>

<p>what value does <code>$sweetNothing</code> have?

<p>The value that <code>$sweetNothing</code> has is a special value in Perl
called <code>undef</code>.  This is frequently expressed in English by saying
that <code>$sweetNothing</code> is undefined.

<p>The <code>undef</code> value is a special one in Perl.  Internally, Perl keeps
track of which variables your program has assigned values to and which
remain undefined.  Thus, when you use a variable in any expression, Perl
can inform you if you are using an undefined value.

<p>For example, consider this program:
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $hasValue = "Hello";
my $hasNoValue;

print "$hasValue $hasNoValue\n";
</pre>
When this program is run, it produces the following output:
<pre>Use of uninitialized value at line 8.
Hello
</pre>

<p>What does this mean?  Perl noticed that we used the uninitialized (i.e.,
undefined) variable, <code>$hasNoValue</code> at line 8 in our program. 
Because we were using <code>warnings</code>, Perl warned us about that use of
the undefined variable.

<p>However, Perl did not crash the program!  Perl is nice enough not to
make undefined variables a hassle.  If you use an undefined variable and
Perl expected a string, Perl uses the empty string, <code>""</code>, in its
place.  If Perl expected a number and gets <code>undef</code>, Perl
substitutes <code>0</code> in its place.

<p>However, when using <code>warnings</code>, Perl will always warn you when you
have used an undefined variable at run-time.  The message will print to
the standard error (which, by default, is the screen) each time Perl
encounters a use of a variable that evaluates to <code>undef</code>.  If you
do not use <code>warnings</code>, the warnings will not print, but you should
probably wait to turn off <code>warnings</code> until you are an experienced
Perl programmer.

<p>Besides producing warning messages, the fact that unassigned variables
are undefined can be useful to us.  The first way is that we can
explicitly test to see if a variable is undefined.  There is a
function that Perl provides called <code>defined</code>.  It can be used to
test if a variable is defined or not.

<p>In addition, Perl permits the programmer to assign a variable the value
<code>undef</code>.  The expression <code>undef</code> is a function provided by
Perl that we can use in place of any expression.  The function
<code>undef</code> is always guaranteed to return an undefined value.  Thus,
we can take a variable that already has a value and make it undefined.

<p>Consider the following program:
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $startUndefined;
my $startDefined = "This one is defined";

print "defined \$startUndefined == ",
      defined $startUndefined,
      ", defined \$startDefined == ",
      defined $startDefined, "\n";

$startUndefined = $startDefined;
$startDefined = undef;

print "defined \$startUndefined == ",
      defined $startUndefined,
      ", defined \$startDefined == ",
      defined $startDefined, "\n";
</pre>
Which produces the output:
<pre>defined $startUndefined == , defined $startDefined == 1
defined $startUndefined == 1, defined $startDefined ==
</pre>

<p>Notice a few things.  First, since we first declared
<code>$startUndefined</code> without giving it a value, it was set to
<code>undef</code>.  However, we gave <code>$startDefined</code> a value when it was
declared, thus it started out defined.  These facts are exemplified by
the output.

<p>To produce that output, we did something that you have not seen yet. 
First, we created some strings that "looked" like the function calls
so our output would reflect what the values of those function calls
were.  Then, we simply used those functions as arguments to the
<code>print</code> function.  This is completely legal in Perl.  You can use
function calls as arguments to other functions.

<p>When you do this, the innermost functions are called first, in their
argument order.  Thus, in our <code>print</code> statements, first
<code>defined $startUndefined</code> is called, followed by <code>defined
$startDefined</code>.  These two functions each evaluate to some value.  That
value then becomes the argument to the <code>print</code> function.

<p>So, what values did <code>defined</code> return?  We can determine the answer
to this question from the printed output.  We can see that when we
called <code>defined</code> on the variable that we started as undefined,
<code>$startUndefined</code>, we got no output for that call (in fact,
<code>defined</code> returned an empty string, <code>""</code>).  When we called
<code>defined</code> on the value that we had assigned to,
<code>$startDefined</code>, we got the output of <code>1</code>.

<p>Thus, from the experiment, we know that when its argument is not
defined, <code>defined</code> returns the value <code>""</code>, otherwise known as
the empty string (which, of course, prints nothing to the standard
output when given as an argument to <code>print</code>).

<p>In addition, we know that when a variable is defined, <code>defined</code>
returns the value <code>1</code>.

<p>Hopefully, you now have some idea of what an <code>undef</code> value is, and
what <code>defined</code> does.  It might not yet be clear why <code>defined</code>
returns an empty string or <code>1</code>.  If you are particularly curious
now, see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#A%20Digression---Truth%20Values">A Digression--Truth Values</a>.

<h2>Operators</h2>

<p>There are a variety of operators that work on scalar values and
variables.  These operators allow us to manipulate scalars in different
ways.  This section discusses the most common of these operators.

<h3>Numerical Operators</h3>

<p>The basic numerical operators in Perl are like others that you might see
in other high level languages.  In fact, Perl's numeric operators were
designed to mimic those in the C programming language.

<p>First, consider this example:
<pre>use strict;
my $x = 5 * 2 + 3;     # $x is 13
my $y = 2 * $x / 4;    # $y is 6.5
my $z = (2 ** 6) ** 2; # $z is 4096
my $a = ($z - 96) * 2; # $a is 8000
my $b = $x % 5;        # 3, 13 modulo 5
</pre>

<p>As you can see from this code, the operators work similar to rules of
algebra.  When using the operators there are two rules that you have to
keep in mind--the rules of <dfn>precedence</dfn> and the rules of
<dfn>associativity</dfn>.

<p>Precedence involves which operators will get evaluated first when the
expression is ambiguous.  For example, consider the first line in our
example, which includes the expression, <code>5 * 2 + 3</code>.  Since the
multiplication operator (<code>*</code>) has precedence over the addition
operator (<code>+</code>), the multiplication operation occurs first.  Thus,
the expression evaluates to <code>10 + 3</code> temporarily, and finally
evaluates to <code>13</code>.  In other words, precedence dictates which
operation occurs first.

<p>What happens when two operations have the same precedence?  That is when
associativity comes into play.  Associativity is either left or right
<a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-7"><sup>7</sup></a>.  For example, in the expression <code>2 * $x / 4</code>
we have two operators with equal precedence, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>. 
Perl needs to make a choice about the order in which they get carried
out.  To do this, it uses the associativity.  Since multiplication and
division are left associative, it works the expression from left to
right, first evaluating to <code>26 / 4</code> (since <code>$x</code> was
<code>13</code>), and then finally evaluating to <code>6.5</code>.

<p>Briefly, for the sake of example, we will take a look at an operator
that is left associative, so we can contrast the difference with right
associativity.  Notice when we used the exponentiation (<code>**</code>)
operator in the example above, we had to write <code>(2 ** 6) ** 2</code>, and
not <code>2 ** 6 ** 2</code>.

<p>What does <code>2 ** 6 ** 2</code> evaluate to?  Since <code>**</code>
(exponentiation) is <strong>right associative</strong>, first the <code>6 ** 2</code>
gets evaluated, yielding the expression <code>2 ** 36</code>, which yields
<code>68719476736</code>, which is  definitely not <code>4096</code>!

<p>Here is a table of the operators we have talked about so far.  They are
listed in order of precedence.  Each line in the table is one order of
precedence.  Naturally, operators on the same line have the same
precedence.  The higher an operator is in the table, the higher its
precedence.

<p><table><tr align="left"><td><strong>Operator</strong> <td><strong>Associativity</strong> <td><strong>Description</strong>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>**      <td>right <td>exponentiation
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>*, /, % <td>left  <td>multiplication, division, modulus
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>+, -    <td>left  <td>addition, subtraction

<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>

<p>Comparing two scalars is quite easy in Perl.  The <dfn>numeric</dfn>
comparison operators that you would find in C, C++, or Java are
available.  However, since Perl does automatic conversion between
strings and numbers for you, you must differentiate for Perl between
numeric and string comparison.  For example, the scalars <code>"532"</code>
and <code>"5"</code> could be compared two different ways--based on numeric
value or <small>ASCII</small> string value.

<p>The following table shows the various comparison operators and what they
do.  Note that in Perl <code>""</code>, <code>0</code> and <code>undef</code> are false
and anything else as true. (This is an over-simplified definition of
true and false in Perl.  See <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#A%20Digression---Truth%20Values">A Digression--Truth Values</a>, for a
complete definition.)

<p>The table below assumes you are executing <code>$left &lt;OP&gt; $right</code>,
where <code>&lt;OP&gt;</code> is the operator in question.

<p><table><tr align="left"><td><strong>Operation</strong> <td><strong>Numeric Version</strong> <td>
 <strong>String Version</strong> <td><strong>Returns</strong>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>less than <td><code>&lt;</code> <td>
 <code>lt</code> <td>1 iff. <code>$left</code> is less than <code>$right</code>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>less than or equal to <td><code>&lt;=</code> <td>
<code>le</code> <td>1 iff. <code>$left</code> is less than or equal to <code>$right</code>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>greater than <td><code>&gt;</code> <td>
<code>gt</code> <td>1 iff. <code>$left</code> is greater than <code>$right</code>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>greater than or equal to <td><code>&gt;=</code> <td>
<code>ge</code> <td>1 iff. <code>$left</code> is greater than or equal to  <code>$right</code>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>equal to <td><code>==</code> <td>
<code>eq</code> <td>1 iff. <code>$left</code> is the same as <code>$right</code>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>not equal to <td><code>!=</code> <td>
<code>ne</code> <td>1 iff. <code>$left</code> is not the same as <code>$right</code>

<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>compare <td><code>&lt;=&gt;</code> <td>
<code>cmp</code> <td>-1 iff. <code>$left</code> is less than <code>$right</code>,
                0 iff. <code>$left</code> is equal to <code>$right</code>
                1 iff. <code>$left</code> is greater than <code>$right</code>
<br></tr></table>

<p>Here are a few examples using these operators.

<pre>use strict;
my $a = 5; my $b = 500;
$a &lt; $b;                 # evaluates to 1
$a &gt;= $b;                # evaluates to ""
$a &lt;=&gt; $b;               # evaluates to -1
my $c = "hello"; my $d = "there";
$d cmp $c;               # evaluates to 1
$d ge  $c;               # evaluates to 1
$c cmp "hello";          # evaluates to ""
</pre>

<br>

<h3>Auto-Increment and Decrement</h3>

<p>The auto-increment and auto-decrement operators in Perl work almost
identically to the corresponding operators in C, C++, or Java.  Here are
few examples:

<pre>use strict;
my $abc = 5;
my $efg = $abc-- + 5;       # $abc is now 4, but $efg is 10
my $hij = ++$efg - --$abc;  # $efg is 11, $abc is 3, $hij is 8
</pre>

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Operators">Operators</a>
<br>

<h3>String Operators</h3>

<p>The final set of operators that we will consider  are those that operate
specifically on strings.  Remember, though, that we can use numbers with
them, as Perl will do the conversions to strings when needed.

<p>The string operators that you will see and use the most are <code>.</code> and
<code>x</code>.  The <code>.</code> operator is string concatenation, and the <code>x</code>
operator is string duplication.

<pre>use strict;
my $greet = "Hi! ";
my $longGreet  = $greet x 3;   # $longGreet is "Hi! Hi! Hi! "
my $hi = $longGreet . "Paul.";  # $hi is "Hi! Hi! Hi! Paul."
</pre>

<h3>Assignment with Operators</h3>

<p>It should be duly noted that it is possible to concatenate, like in C, an
operator onto the assignment statement to abbreviate using the left hand
side as the first operand.  For example,
<pre>use strict;
my $greet = "Hi! ";
$greet  .= "Everyone\n";
$greet  = $greet . "Everyone\n"; # Does the same operation
                                 # as the line above
</pre>

<p>This works for any simple, binary operator.

<h2>Output of Scalar Data</h2>

<p>To output a scalar, you can use the <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> built-in
functions.  We have already seen examples of the <code>print</code> command, and
the <code>printf</code> command is very close to that in C or C++.  Here are a few
examples:

<pre>use strict;
my $str  = "Howdy, ";
my $name = "Joe.\n";
print $str, $name;    # Prints out: Howdy, Joe.&lt;NEWLINE&gt;
my $f = 3e-1;
printf "%2.3f\n", $f; # Prints out: 0.300&lt;NEWLINE&gt;

<br>

<h2>Special Variables</h2>

<p>It is worth noting here that there are some variables that are considered
"special" by Perl.  These variables are usually either read-only variables
that Perl sets for you automatically based on what you are doing in the
program, or variables you can set to control the behavior of how Perl
performs certain operations.

<p>Use of special variables can be problematic, and can often cause unwanted
side effects.  It is a good idea to limit your use of these special
variables until you are completely comfortable with them and what they do. 
Of course, like anything in Perl, you can get used to some special variables
and not others, and use only those with which you are comfortable.

<h2>Summary of Scalar Operators</h2>

<p>In this chapter, we have looked at a number of different scalar
operators available in the Perl language.  Earlier, we gave a small
chart of the operators, ordered by their precedence.  Now that we have
seen all these operators, we should consider a list of them again,
ordered by precedence.  Note that some operators are listed as
"nonassoc".  This means that the given operator is not associative. 
In other words, it simply does not make sense to consider associative
evaluation of the given operator.

<p><table><tr align="left"><td><strong>Operator</strong> <td><strong>Associativity</strong> <td><strong>Description</strong>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>++</code>, <code>--</code> <td>nonassoc <td>auto-increment and auto-decrement
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>**</code>      <td>right <td>exponentiation
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%</code> <td>left  <td>multiplication, division, modulus
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>    <td>left  <td>addition, subtraction, concatenation
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>lt</code>, <code>gt</code>, <code>le</code>, <code>ge</code>  <td>nonassoc  <td>comparison operators
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td><code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>, <code>eq</code>, <code>ne</code>, <code>cmp</code>  <td>nonassoc  <td>comparison operators
<br></tr></table>

<p>This list is actually still quite incomplete, as we will learn more
operators later on.  However, you can always find a full list of all
operators in Perl in the <cite>perlop</cite> documentation page, which you can
get to on most systems with Perl installed by typing <code>perldoc
perlop</code>.

<h1>Arrays</h1>

<p>Now that we have a good understanding of the way scalar data and variables
work and what can be done with them in Perl, we will look into the most
basic of Perl's natural data structures--arrays.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>
<br>

<h2>The Semantics of Arrays</h2>

<p>The arrays in Perl are semantically closest to lists in Lisp or Scheme
(sans cons cells), however the syntax that is used to access arrays is
closer to arrays in C.  In fact, one can often treat Perl's arrays as
if they were simply C arrays, but they are actually much more powerful
than that.

<p>Perl arrays grow and shrink dynamically as needed.  The more data you
put into a Perl list, the bigger it gets.  As you remove elements from
the list, the list will shrink to the right size.  Note that this is
inherently different from arrays in the C language, where the programmer
must keep track and control the size of the array.

<p>However, Perl arrays are accessible just like C arrays.  So, you can
subscript to anywhere within a given list at will.  There is no need to
process through the first four elements of the list to get the fifth
element (as in Scheme).  In this manner, you get the advantages of both
a dynamic list, and a static-size array.

<p>The only penalty that you pay for this flexibility is that when an array
is growing very large very quickly, it can be a bit inefficient. 
However, when this must occur, Perl allows you to pre-build an array of
certain size.  We will show how to do this a bit later.

<p>A Perl array is always a list of scalars.  Of course, since Perl makes
no direct distinction between numeric and string values, you can easily
mix different types of scalars within the same array.  However,
everything in the array must be a scalar<a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-8"><sup>8</sup></a>.

<p>Note the difference in terminology that is used here.  Arrays refer to
<em>variables</em> that store a list of scalar values.  Lists can be
written as literals (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#List%20Literals">List Literals</a>) and used in a variety of
ways.  One of the ways that list literals can be used is to assign to
array variables (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Array%20Variables">Array Variables</a>).  We will discuss both list
literals and array variables in this chapter.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>
<br>

<h2>List Literals</h2>

<p>Like scalars, it is possible to write lists as literals right in your
code.  Of course, as with inserting string literals in your code, you
must use proper quoting.

<p>There are two primary ways to quote list literals that we will discuss
here.  One is using <code>()</code>, and the other is using what is called a
quoting operator.  The quoting operator for lists is <code>qw</code>.  A
quoting operator is always followed by a single character, which is the
"stop character".  It will eat up all the following input until the
next "stop character".  In the case of <code>qw</code>, it will use each
token that it finds as an element in a list until the second "stop
character" is reached.  The advantage of the <code>qw</code> operator is that
you do not need to quote strings in any additional way, since <code>qw</code>
is already doing the quoting for you.

<p>Here are a few examples of some list literals, using both <code>()</code> and
the <code>qw</code> operator.

<pre>();                   # this list has no elements; the empty list
qw//;                 # another empty list
("a", "b", "c",
  1,  2,  3);         # a list with six elements
qw/hello world
  how are you today/; # another list with six elements
</pre>

<p>Note that when we use the <code>()</code>, we have to quote all strings, and we
need to separate everything by commas.  The <code>qw</code> operator does not
require this.

<p>Finally, if you have any two scalar values where  all the values between
them can be enumerated, you can use an operator called the <code>..</code>
operator to build a list.  This is most easily seen in an example:

<pre>(1 .. 100);     # a list of 100 elements: the numbers from 1 to 100
('A' .. 'Z');   # a list of 26 elements: the uppercase letters From A to Z
('01' .. '31'); # a list of 31 elements: all possible days of a month
                #    with leading zeros on the single digit days
</pre>

<p>You will find the <code>..</code> operator particularly useful with slices, which
we will talk about later in this chapter.

<h2>Array Variables</h2>

<p>As with scalars, what good are literals if you cannot have variables?  So,
Perl provides a way to make array variables.

<ul>

<li><a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Associated%20Scalars">Associated Scalars</a>:

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Array%20Variables">Array Variables</a>
<br>

<h3>Array Variables</h3>

<p>Each variable in Perl starts with a special character that identifies
what type of variable it is.  We saw that scalar variables always start
with a <code>$</code>.  Similarly, all array variables start with the
character, <code>@</code>, under the same naming rules that are used for
scalar variables.

<p>Of course, we cannot do much with a variable if we cannot assign things
to it, so the assignment operator works as perfectly with arrays as it
did with scalars.  We must be sure, though, to always make the right
hand side of the assignment a list, not a scalar!  Here are a few
examples:

<pre>use strict;
my @stuff  = qw/a  b  c/;            # @stuff a three element list
my @things = (1, 2, 3, 4);           # @things is a four element list
my $oneThing = "all alone";
my @allOfIt = (@stuff, $oneThing,
               @things);             # @allOfIt has 8 elements!
</pre>

<p>Note the cute thing we can do with the <code>()</code> when assigning
<code>@allOfIt</code>.  When using <code>()</code>, Perl allows us to insert other
variables in the list.  These variables can be either scalar or array
variables!  So, you can quickly build up a new list by "concatenating"
other lists and scalar variables together.  Then, that new list can be
assigned to a new array, or used in any other way that list literals can
be used.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Array%20Variables">Array Variables</a>
<br>

<h3>Associated Scalars</h3>

<p>Every time an array variable is declared, a special set of scalar
variables automatically springs into existence, and those scalars change
along with changes in the array with which they are associated.

<p>First of all, for an array, <code>@array</code>, of n elements.  There
are scalar variables <code>$array[0]</code>, <code>$array[1]</code>, <small>...</small>,
<code>$array[n-1]</code> that contain first, second, third, <small>...</small>,
nth elements in the array, respectively.  The variables in this
format are full-fledged scalar variables.  This means that anything you
can do with a scalar variable, you can do with these elements.  This
provides a way to access array elements by subscript.  In addition, it
provides a way to change, modify and update individual elements without
actually using the <code>@array</code> variable.

<p>Another scalar variable that is associated to any array variable,
<code>@array</code>, is <code>$#array</code>.  This variable always contains the
<dfn>subscript</dfn> of the last element in the array.  In other words,
<code>$array[$#array]</code> is always the last element of the array.  The
length of the array is always <code>$#array + 1</code>.  Again, you are
permitted to do anything with this variable that you can normally do
with any other scalar variable; however, you must always make sure to
leave the value as an integer greater than or equal to -1.  In fact, if
you know an array is going to grow very large quickly, you probably want
to set this variable to a very high value.  When you change the value of
<code>$#array</code>, you not only resize the array for your use, you also
direct Perl to allocate a specific amount of space for <code>@array</code>.

<p>Here are a few examples that use the associated scalar variables for an
array:

<pre>use strict;
my @someStuff = qw/Hello and
                  welcome/;     # @someStuff: an array of 3 elements
$#someStuff = 0;                # @someStuff now is simply ("Hello")
$someStuff[1] = "Joe";          # Now @someStuff is ("Hello", "Joe")
$#someStuff  = -1;              # @someStuff is now empty
@someStuff   = ();              # does same thing as previous line
</pre>

<h2>Manipulating Arrays and Lists</h2>

<p>Clearly, arrays and lists are very useful.  However, there are a few
more things in Perl you can use to make arrays and lists even more
useful.

<br>

<h3>It Slices!</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you may want to create a new array based on some subset of
elements from another array.  To do this, you use a slice.  Slices use a
subscript that is itself a list of integers to grab a list of elements
from an array.  This looks easier in Perl than it does in English:

<pre>use strict;
my @stuff = qw/everybody wants a rock/;
my @rock  = @stuff[1 .. $#stuff];      # @rock is qw/wants a rock/
my @want  = @stuff[ 0 .. 1];           # @want is qw/everybody wants/
@rock     = @stuff[0, $#stuff];        # @rock is qw/everybody rock/
</pre>

<p>As you can see, you can use both the <code>..</code> operator and commas to
build a list for use as a slice subscript.  This can be a very useful
feature for array manipulation.

<br>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Perl also provides quite a few functions that operate on arrays.  As you
learn more and more Perl, you will see lots of interesting functions
that work with arrays.

<p>Now, we'll discuss a few of these functions that work on arrays:
<code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, and <code>unshift</code>.

<p>The names <code>shift</code> and <code>unshift</code> are an artifact of the
Unix shells that used them to "shift around" incoming arguments.

<ul>
<li><a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Arrays%20as%20Stacks">Arrays as Stacks</a>:

<br>

<h4>Arrays as Stacks</h4>

<p>What more is a stack than an unbounded array of things?  This attitude
is seen in Perl through the <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> functions.  These
functions treat the "right hand side" (i.e., the end) of the array as
the top of the stack.  Here is an example:

<pre>use strict;
my @stack;
push(@stack, 7, 6, "go");   # @stack is now qw/7 6 go/
my $action = pop @stack;    # $action is "go", @stack is (7, 6)
my $value = pop(@stack) +
            pop(@stack);    # value is 6 + 7 = 13, @stack is empty
</pre>

<br>

<h4>Arrays as Queues</h4>

<p>If we can do stacks, then why not queues?  You can build a queue in Perl
by using the <code>unshift</code> and <code>pop</code> functions
together.<a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-9"><sup>9</sup></a>  Think of the <code>unshift</code> function as "enqueue" and the
<code>pop</code> function as "dequeue".  Here is an example:

<pre>use strict;
my @queue;
unshift (@queue, "Customer 1"); # @queue is now ("Customer 1")
unshift (@queue, "Customer 2"); # @queue is now ("Customer 2" "Customer 1")
unshift (@queue, "Customer 3");
          # @queue is now ("Customer 3" "Customer 2" "Customer 1")
my $item = pop(@queue);         # @queue is now ("Customer 3" "Customer 2")
print "Servicing $item\n";       # prints:  Servicing Customer 1\n
$item = pop(@queue);            # @queue is now ("Customer 3")
print "Servicing $item\n";       # prints:  Servicing Customer 2\n
</pre>

<p>This queue example works because <code>unshift</code> places items onto the
front of the array, and <code>pop</code> takes items from the end of the
array.  However, be careful using more than two arguments on the
<code>unshift</code> when you want to process an array as a queue.  Recall
that <code>unshift</code> places its arguments onto the array <em>in order</em>
as they are listed in the function call.  Consider this example:

<pre>
use strict;
my @notAqueue;
unshift(@notAqueue, "Customer 0", "Customer 1");
                                 # @queue is now ("Customer 0", "Customer 1")
unshift (@notAqueue, "Customer 2");
                    # @queue is now ("Customer 2", "Customer 0", "Customer 1")
</pre>

<p>Notice that this variable, <code>@notAqueue</code>, is not really a queue, if
we use <code>pop</code> to remove items.  The moral here is to be careful when
using <code>unshift</code> in this manner, since it places it arguments on the
array <em>in order</em>.

<h3>The Context--List vs. Scalar</h3>

<p>It may have occurred to you by now that in certain places we can use a
list, and in other places we can use a scalar.  Perl knows this as well,
and decides which is permitted by something called a <dfn>context</dfn>.

<p>The context can be either list context or scalar context.  Many operations
do different things depending on what the current context is.

<p>For example, it is actually valid to use an array variable, such as
<code>@array</code>, in a scalar context.  When you do this, the array variable
evaluates to the number of elements in the array.  Consider this example:

<pre>use strict;
my @things = qw/a few of my favorite/;
my $count  = @things;                   # $count is 5
my @moreThings = @things;               # @moreThings is same as @things
</pre>

<p>Note that Perl knows not to try and stuff <code>@things</code> into a scalar,
which does not make any sense.  It evaluates <code>@things</code> in a scalar
context and given the number of elements in the array.

<p>You must always be aware of the context of your operations.  Assuming the
wrong context can cause a plethora of problems for the new Perl programmer.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Manipulating%20Arrays%20and%20Lists">Manipulating Arrays and Lists</a>
<br>

<h3>Array Interpolation</h3>

<p>Array variables can also be evaluated through interpolation into a
double-quoted string.  This works very much like the interpolation of
scalars into double-quoted strings (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Scalar%20Interpolation">Scalar Interpolation</a>).  When
an array variable is encountered in a double-quoted string, Perl will
join the array together, separating each element by spaces.  Here is an
example:

<pre>use strict;
my @saying = qw/these are a few of my favorite/;
my $statement = "@saying things.\n";
         # $statement is "these are a few of my favorite things.\n"
my $stuff = "@saying[0 .. 1] @saying[$#saying - 1, $#saying]  things.\n"
         # $stuff is "these are my favorite things.\n"
</pre>

<p>Note the use of slices when assigning <code>$stuff</code>.  As you can see,
Perl can be very expressive when we begin to use the interaction of
different, interesting features.

<h1>Control Structures</h1>

<p>The center of any imperative programming language is control structures. 
Although Perl is not purely an imperative programming language, it has
ancestors that are very much imperative in nature, and thus Perl has
inherited those same control structures.  It also has added a few of its
own.

<p>As you begin to learn about Perl's control structures, realize that a
good number of them are syntactic sugar.  You can survive using only a
subset of all the control structures that are available in Perl.  You
should use those with which you are comfortable.  Obey the "hubris" of
Perl, and write code that is readable.  But, beyond that, do not use any
control structures that you do not think you need.

<br>

<h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>The first tool that you need to begin to use control structures is the
ability to write code "blocks".  A block of code could be any of the code
examples that we have seen thus far.  The only difference is, to make them a
block, we would surround them with <code>{}</code>.

<pre>use strict;
{
my $var;
Statement;
Statement;
Statement;
}
</pre>

<p>Anything that looks like that is a block.  Blocks are very simple, and are
much like code blocks in languages like C, C++, and Java.  However, in Perl,
code blocks are decoupled from any particular control structure.  The above
code example is a valid piece of Perl code that can appear just about
anywhere in a Perl program.  Of course, it is only particularly useful for
those functions and structures that use blocks.

<p>Note that any variable declared in the block (in the example,
<code>$var</code>) lives only until the end of that block.  With variables
declared <code>my</code>, normal lexical scoping that you are familiar with in
C, C++, or Java applies.

<h2>A Digression--Truth Values</h2>

<p>We have mentioned truth and "true and false" a few times now; however,
we have yet to give a clear definition of what truth values are in Perl.

<p>Every expression in Perl has a truth value.  Usually, we ignore the
truth value of the expressions we use.  In fact, we have been ignoring
them so far!  However, now that we are going to begin studying various
control structures that rely on the truth value of a given expression,
we should look at true and false values in Perl a bit more closely.

<p>The basic rule that most Perl programmers remember is that <code>0</code>, the
empty string and <code>undef</code> are false, and everything else is true. 
However, it turns out that this rule is not actually completely
accurate.

<p>The actual rule is as follows:

<p>Everything in Perl is true, except:
<ul>

<li>the strings <code>""</code> (the empty string) and <code>"0"</code> (the
string containing only the character, 0), or any string expression that
evaluates to either <code>""</code> (the empty string) or <code>"0"</code>.

<li>any numeric expression that evaluates to a numeric <code>0</code>.

<li>any value that is not defined (i.e., equivalent to
      <code>undef</code>).

</ul>

<p>If that rule is not completely clear, the following table gives some
example Perl expressions and states whether they are true or not:

<p><table><tr align="left"><td><strong>Expression</strong> <td><strong>String/Number?</strong> <td><strong>Boolean value</strong>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>0     <td>number <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>0.0   <td>number <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>0.0000 <td>number <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>""   <td>string <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>"0"   <td>string <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>"0.0" <td>string <td><strong>true</strong>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>undef <td>N/A    <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>42 - (6 * 7) <td>number <td>false
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>"0.0" + 0.0 <td>number <td><strong>false</strong>
<br></tr><tr align="left"><td>"foo"   <td>string <td>true
<br></tr></table>

<p>There are two expressions above that easily confuse new Perl
programmers.  First of all, the expression <code>"0.0"</code> is true.  This
is true because it is a string that is not <code>"0"</code>.  The only string
that is not empty that can be false is <code>"0"</code>.  Thus, <code>"0.0"</code>
must be true.

<p>Next, consider <code>"0.0" + 0.0</code>.  After what was just stated, one
might assume that this expression is true.  However, this expression is
<strong>false</strong>.    It is false because <code>+</code> is a numeric operator,
and as such, <code>"0.0"</code> must be turned into its numeric equivalent. 
Since the numeric equivalent to <code>"0.0"</code> is <code>0.0</code>, we get the
expression <code>0.0 + 0.0</code>, which evaluates to <code>0.0</code>, which is the
same as <code>0</code>, which is false.

<p>Finally, it should be noted that all references are true.  The topic of
Perl references is beyond the scope of this book.  However, if we did
not mention it, we would not be giving you the whole truth story.

<h2>The if/unless Structures</h2>

<p>The <code>if</code> and <code>unless</code> structures are the simplest control
structures.  You are no doubt comfortable with <code>if</code> statements from
C, C++, or Java.  Perl's <code>if</code> statements work very much the same.

<pre>use strict;
if (expression) {
    Expression_True_Statement;
    Expression_True_Statement;
    Expression_True_Statement;
} elsif (another_expression) {
    Expression_Elseif_Statement;
    Expression_Elseif_Statement;
    Expression_Elseif_Statement;
} else {
    Else_Statement;
    Else_Statement;
    Else_Statement;
}
</pre>

<p>There are a few things to note here.  The <code>elsif</code> and the <code>else</code>
statements are both optional when using an <code>if</code>.  It should also be
noted that after each <code>if (expression)</code> or <code>elsif (expression)</code>,
a code <dfn>block</dfn> is required.  These means that the <code>{}</code>'s are
mandatory in all cases, even if you have only one statement inside.

<p>The <code>unless</code> statement works just like an <code>if</code> statement. 
However, you replace <code>if</code> with <code>unless</code>, and the code block is
executed only if the expression is <dfn>false</dfn> rather than true.

<p>Thus <code>unless (expression) { }</code> is functionally equivalent to
<code>if (! expression) { }</code>.

<br>

<h2>The while/until Structures</h2>

<p>The <code>while</code> structure is equivalent to the <code>while</code> structures
in Java, C, or C++.  The code executes while the expression remains
true.

<pre>use strict;
while (expression) {
    While_Statement;
    While_Statement;
    While_Statement;
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>until (expression)</code> structure is functionally equivalent
<code>while (! expression)</code>.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Control%20Structures">Control Structures</a>
<br>

<h2>The do  while/until Structures</h2>

<p>The <code>do/while</code> structure  works similar to the <code>while</code> structure,
except that the code is executed at least once before the condition is
checked.

<pre>use strict;
do {
    DoWhile_Statement;
    DoWhile_Statement;
    DoWhile_Statement;
} while (expression);
</pre>

<p>Again, using <code>until (expression)</code> is the same as using
<code>while (! expression)</code>.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Control%20Structures">Control Structures</a>
<br>

<h2>The for Structure</h2>

<p>The <code>for</code> structure works similarly to the <code>for</code> structure
found in C, C++ or Java.  It is really syntactic sugar for the
<code>while</code> statement.

<p>Thus:
<pre>use strict;
for(Initial_Statement; expression; Increment_Statement) {
    For_Statement;
    For_Statement;
    For_Statement;
}
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to:

<pre>use strict;
Initial_Statement;
while (expression) {
    For_Statement;
    For_Statement;
    For_Statement;
    Increment_Statement;
}

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Control%20Structures">Control Structures</a>
<br>

<h2>The foreach Structure</h2>

<p>The <code>foreach</code> control structure is the most interesting in this
chapter.  It is specifically designed for processing of Perl's native data
types.

<p>The <code>foreach</code> structure takes a scalar, a list and a block, and
executes the block of code, setting the scalar to each value in the list,
one at a time.  Consider an example:

<pre>use strict;
my @collection = qw/hat shoes shirts shorts/;
foreach my $item (@collection) {
    print "$item\n";
}
</pre>

<p>This will print out each item in collection on a line by itself.  Note that
you are permitted to declare the scalar variable right with the
<code>foreach</code>.   When you do this, the variable lives only as long as the
<code>foreach</code> does.

<p>You will find <code>foreach</code> to be one of the most useful looping structures
in Perl.  Any time you need to do something to each element in the list,
chances are, using a <code>foreach</code> is the best choice.

<h1>Associative Arrays (Hashes)</h1>

<p>This chapter will introduce the third major Perl abstract data type,
associative arrays.  Also known as hashes, associative arrays provide
native language support for one of the most useful data structures that
programmers implement--the hash table.

<h2>What Is It?</h2>

<p>Associative arrays, also frequently called <dfn>hashes</dfn>, are the third
major data type in Perl after scalars and arrays.  Hashes are named as
such because they work very similarly to a common data structure that
programmers use in other languages--hash tables.  However, hashes in
Perl are actually a direct <em>language supported</em> data type.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Associative%20Arrays%20(Hashes)">Associative Arrays (Hashes)</a>
<br>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>We have seen that each of the different native data types in Perl has a
special character that identify that the variable is of that type. 
Hashes always start with a <code>%</code>.

<p>Accessing a hash works very similar to accessing arrays.  However, hashes are
not subscripted by numbers.  They can be subscripted by an arbitrary scalar
value.  You simply use the <code>{}</code> to subscript the value instead of
<code>[]</code> as you did with arrays.  Here is an example:

<pre>use strict;
my %table;
$table{'schmoe'} = 'joe';
$table{7.5}  = 2.6;
</pre>

<p>In this example, our hash, called, <code>%table</code>, has two entries.  The key
<code>'schmoe'</code> is associated with the value <code>'joe'</code>, and the key
<code>7.5</code> is associated with the value <code>2.6</code>.

<p>Just like with array elements, hash elements can be used anywhere a
scalar variable is permitted.  Thus, given a <i>%table</i> built with
the code above, we can do the following:

<pre>print "$table{'schmoe'}\n";    # outputs "joe\n"
--$table{7.5};                 # $table{7.5} now contains 1.6
</pre>

<p>Another interesting fact is that all hash variables can be evaluated in
the list context.  When done, this gives a list whose odd elements are
the keys of the hash, and whose even elements are the corresponding
values.  Thus, assuming we have the same <code>%table</code> from above, we
can execute:

<pre>my @tableListed = %table;  # @tableListed is qw/schmoe joe 7.5 1.6/
</pre>

<p>If you happen to evaluate a hash in scalar context, it will give you
<code>undef</code> if no entries have yet been defined, and will evaluate to true
otherwise.  However, evaluation of hashes in scalar context is not
recommended.  To test if a hash is defined, use <code>defined(%hash)</code>.

<br>

<h2>Literals</h2>

<p>"Hash literals" per se do not exist.  However, remember that when we
evaluate a hash in the list context, we get the pairs of the hash unfolded
into the list.  We can exploit this to do hash literals.  We simply write
out the list pairs that we want placed into the hash.  For example:

<pre>use strict;
my %table = qw/schmoe joe 7.5 1.6/;
</pre>
would give us the same hash we had in the previous example.

<br>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>You should realize that any function you already know that works on arrays
will also work on hashes, since you can always evaluate a hash in the list
context and get the pair list.  However, there are a variety of functions
that are specifically designed and optimized for use with hashes.

<br>

<h3>Keys and Values</h3>

<p>When we evaluate a hash in a list context, Perl gives us the paired list
that can be very useful.  However, sometimes we may only want to look at
the list of keys, or the list of values.  Perl provides two optimized
functions for doing this: <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code>.

<pre>use strict;
my %table = qw/schmoe joe smith john simpson bart/;
my @lastNames  = keys %table;    # @lastNames is: qw/schmoe smith simpson/
my @firstNames = values %table;  # @firstNames is: qw/joe john bart/
</pre>

<p><hr>
Node:<a name="Each">Each</a>,
Previous:<a rel=previous href="pickingUpPerl.html#Keys%20and%20Values">Keys and Values</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Hash%20Functions">Hash Functions</a>
<br>

<h3>Each</h3>

<p>The <code>each</code> function is one that you will find particularly useful when
you need to go through each element in the hash.  The <code>each</code> function
returns each key-value pair from the hash one by one as a list of two
elements.  You can use this function to run a <code>while</code> across the hash:

<pre>use strict;
my %table = qw/schmoe joe smith john simpson bart/;
my($key, $value);  # Declare two variables at once
while ( ($key, $value) = each(%table) ) {
    # Do some processing on <code>$key</code> and <code>$value</code>
}
</pre>

<p>This <code>while</code> terminates because <code>each</code> returns <code>undef</code>
when all the pairs have been exhausted.  However, be careful.  Any
change in the hash made will "reset" the <code>each</code> function for that
hash.

<p>So, if you need to loop and change values in the hash, use the following
<code>foreach</code> across the keys:

<pre>use strict;
my %table = qw/schmoe joe smith john simpson bart/;
foreach my $key (keys %table) {
    # Do some processing on $key and $table{$key}
}
</pre>

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Associative%20Arrays%20(Hashes)">Associative Arrays (Hashes)</a>
<br>

<h2>Slices</h2>

<p>It turns out you can slice hashes just like you were able to slice arrays. 
This can be useful if you need to extract a certain set of values out of a
hash into a list.

<pre>use strict;
my %table = qw/schmoe joe smith john simpson bart/;
my @friends = @table{'schmoe', 'smith'};   # @friends has qw/joe john/
</pre>

<p>Note the use of the <code>@</code> in front of the hash name.  This shows that we
are indeed producing a normal list, and you can use this construct in any
list context you would like.

<h2>Context Considerations</h2>

<p>We have now discussed all the different ways you can use variables in
list and scalar context.  At this point, it might be helpful to review
all the ways we have used variables in different contexts.  The table

<h1>Regular Expressions</h1>

<p>One of Perl's original applications was text processing (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Perl">A Brief History of Perl</a>).  So far, we have seen easy manipulation of scalar and
list data is in Perl, but we have yet to explore the core of Perl's text
processing construct--regular expressions.  To remedy that, this
chapter is devoted completely to regular expressions.

<h2>The Theory Behind It All</h2>

<p>Regular expressions are a concept borrowed from automata theory. 
Regular expressions provide a a way to describe a "language" of
strings.

<p>The term, <dfn>language</dfn>, when used in the sense borrowed from automata
theory, can be a bit confusing.  A <dfn>language</dfn> in automata theory is
simply some (possibly infinite) set of strings.  Each string (which can
be possibly empty) is composed of a set of characters from a fixed,
finite set.  In our case, this set will be all the possible
<small>ASCII</small> characters<a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-10"><sup>10</sup></a>.

<p>When we write a regular expression, we are writing a description of some
set of possible strings.  For the regular expression to have meaning,
this set of possible strings that we are defining should have some
meaning to us.

<p>Regular expressions give us extreme power to do pattern matching on text
documents.  We can use the regular expression syntax to write a succinct
description of the entire, infinite class of strings that fit our
specification.  In addition, anyone else who understands the description
language of regular expressions, can easily read out description and
determine what set of strings we want to match.  Regular expressions are a
universal description for matching regular strings.

<p>When we discuss regular expressions, we discuss "matching".  If a
regular expression "matches" a given string, then that string is in
the class we described with the regular expression.  If it does not
match, then the string is not in the desired class.

<h2>The Simple</h2>

<p>We can start our discussion of regular expression by considering the
simplest of operators that can actually be used to create all possible
regular expressions <a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-11"><sup>11</sup></a>.  All the other
regular expression operators can actually be reduced into a set of these
simple operators.

<h3>Simple Characters</h3>

<p>In regular expressions, generally, a character matches itself.  The only
exceptions are regular expression special characters.  To match one of
these special characters, you must put a <code>\</code> before the character.

<p>For example, the regular expression <code>abc</code> matches a set of strings
that contain <code>abc</code> somewhere in them.  Since <code>*</code> happens to be
a regular expression special character, the regular expression <code>\*</code>
matches any string that contains the <code>*</code> character.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#The%20Simple">The Simple</a>
<br>

<h3>The * Special Character</h3>

<p>As we mentioned <code>*</code> is a regular expression special character.  The
<code>*</code> is used to indicate that zero or more of the previous
characters should be matched.  Thus, the regular expression <code>a*</code>
will match any string that contains zero or more <code>a</code>'s.

<p>Note that since <code>a*</code> will match any string with zero or more
<code>a</code>'s, <code>a*</code> will match <em>all</em> strings, since all strings
(including the empty string) contain at least zero <code>a</code>'s.  So,
<code>a*</code> is not a very useful regular expression.

<p>A more useful regular expression might be <code>baa*</code>.  This regular
expression will match any string that has a <code>b</code>, followed by one or
more <code>a</code>'s.  Thus, the set of strings we are matching are those
that contain <code>ba</code>, <code>baa</code>, <code>baaa</code>, etc.  In other words,
we are looking to see if there is any "sheep speech" hidden in our
text.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#The%20Simple">The Simple</a>
<br>

<h3>The . Character</h3>

<p>The next special character we will consider is the <code>.</code> character.  The
<code>.</code> will match any valid character.  As an example, consider the
regular expression <code>a.c</code>.  This regular expression will match any
string that contains an <code>a</code> and a <code>c</code>, with any possible character
in between.  Thus, strings that contain <code>abc</code>, <code>acc</code>, <code>amc</code>,
etc.  are all in the class of strings that this regular expression
matches.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#The%20Simple">The Simple</a>
<br>

<h3>The | Character</h3>

<p>The <code>|</code> special character is equivalent to an "or" in regular
expressions.  This character is used to give a choice.  So, the regular
expression <code>abc|def</code> will match any string that contains either
<code>abc</code> or <code>def</code>.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#The%20Simple">The Simple</a>
<br>

<h3>Grouping with ()s</h3>

<p>Sometimes, within regular expressions, we want to group things together. 
Doing this allows building of larger regular expressions based on smaller
components.  The <code>()</code>'s are used for grouping.

<p>For example, if we want to match any string that contains <code>abc</code> or
<code>def</code>, zero or more times, surrounded by a <code>xx</code> on either side,
we could write the regular expression <code>xx(abc|def)*xx</code>.  This
applies the <code>*</code> character to everything that is in the parentheses. 
Thus we can match any strings such as <code>xxabcxx</code>, <code>xxabcdefxx</code>,
etc.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#The%20Simple">The Simple</a>
<br>

<h3>The Anchor Characters</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we want to apply the regular expression from a defined point. 
In other words, we want to anchor the regular expression so it is not
permitted to match anywhere in the string, just from a certain point.

<p>The anchor operators allow us to do this.  When we start a regular
expression with a <code>^</code>, it anchors the regular expression to the
beginning of the string.  This means that whatever the regular
expression starts with <em>must be</em> matched at the beginning of the
string.  For example, <code>^aa*</code> will not match strings that contain
one or more <code>a</code>'s; rather it matches strings that <em>start</em> with
one or more <code>a</code>'s.

<p>We can also use the <code>$</code> at the end of the string to anchor the
regular expression at the end of the string.  If we applied this to our
last regular expression, we have <code>^aa*$</code> which now matches
<em>only</em> those strings that consist of one or more <code>a</code>'s.  This
makes it clear that the regular expression cannot just look anywhere in
the string, rather the regular expression must be able to match the
entire string exactly, or it will not match at all.

<p>In most cases, you will want to either anchor a regular expression to
the start of the string, the end of the string, or both.  Using a
regular expression without some sort of anchor can also produce
confusing and strange results.  However, it is occasionally useful.

<h2>Pattern Matching</h2>

<p>Now that you are familiar with some of the basics of regular
expressions, you probably want to know how to use them in Perl.  Doing
so is very easy.  There is an operator, <code>=~</code>, that you can use to
match a regular expression against scalar variables.  Regular
expressions in Perl are placed between two forward slashes (i.e.,
<code>//</code>).  The whole <code>$scalar =~ //</code> expression will evaluate to
<code>1</code> if a match occurs, and <code>undef</code> if it does not.

<p>Consider the following code sample:
<pre>use strict;
while ( defined($currentLine = &lt;STDIN&gt;) ) {
    if ($currentLine =~ /^(J|R)MS speaks:/) {
        print $currentLine;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>This code will go through each line of the input, and print only those lines
that start with "JMS speaks:" or "RMS speaks:".

<br>

<h2>Regular Expression Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Writing out regular expressions can be problematic.  For example, if we want
to have a regular expression that matches all digits, we have to write:
<pre>(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)
</pre>

<p>It would be terribly annoying to have to write such things out.  So, Perl
gives an incredible number of shortcuts for writing regular expressions. 
These are largely syntactic sugar, since we could write out regular
expressions in the same way we did above.  However, that is too cumbersome.

<p>For example, for ranges of values, we can use the brackets, <code>[]</code>'s. 
So, for our digit expression above, we can write <code>[0-9]</code>.  In fact,
it is even easier in perl, because <code>\d</code> will match that very same
thing.

<p>There are lots of these kinds of shortcuts.  They are listed in the
<code>perlre</code> online manual.  They are listed in many places, so there
is no need to list them again here.

<p>However, as you learn about all the regular expression shortcuts,
remember that they can all be reduced to the original operators we
discussed above.  They are simply short ways of saying things that can
be built with regular characters, <code>*</code>, <code>()</code>, and <code>|</code>.

<h1>Subroutines</h1>

<p>Until now, all the Perl programs that we have written have  simply a set of
instructions, line by line.  Like any good language, Perl allows one to
write modular code.  To do this, at the very least, the language must allow
the programmer to set aside subroutines of code that can be reused.  Perl,
of course, provides this feature.

<p>Note that many people call Perl subroutines "functions".  We prefer to
use the term "functions" for those routines that are built in to Perl,
and "subroutines" for code written by the Perl programmer.  This is
not standard terminology, so you may hear others use subroutines and
functions interchangeably, but that will not be the case in this book. 
We feel that it is easier to make the distinction if we have two
different terms for functions and subroutines.

<p>Note that user subroutines can be used anywhere it is valid to use a native
Perl function.

<br>

<h2>Defining Subroutines</h2>

<p>Defining a subroutine is quite easy.  You use the keyword <code>sub</code>,
followed by the name of your subroutine, followed by a code block.  This
friendly subroutine can be used to greet the user:

<pre>use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   print "Hello everyone.\nWhere do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
</pre>

<p>Now, anywhere in the code where we want to greet the user, we can simply
say:
<pre>&amp;HowdyEveryone;
</pre>
and it will print that message to the user.  In fact, in most cases, the
<code>&amp;</code> for invoking subroutines is optional.

Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Subroutines">Subroutines</a>
<br>

<h2>Returning Values</h2>

<p>Perhaps we did not want our new subroutine to actually print the
message.  Instead, we would like it to return the string of the message,
and then we will call <code>print</code> on it.

<p>This is very easy to do with the <code>return</code> statement.

<pre>use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   return "Hello everyone.\nWhere do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
print &amp;HowdyEveryone;
</pre>

Previous:<a rel=previous href="pickingUpPerl.html#Returning%20Values">Returning Values</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="pickingUpPerl.html#Subroutines">Subroutines</a>
<br>

<h2>Using Arguments</h2>

<p>A subroutine is not much good if you cannot give it input on which to
operate.  Of course, Perl allows you to pass arguments to subroutines just
like you would to native Perl functions.

<p>At the start of each subroutine, Perl sets a special array variable,
<code>@_</code>, to be the list of arguments sent into the subroutine.  By
standard convention, you can  access these variables through
<code>$_[0 .. $#_]</code>.  However, it is a good idea to instead immediately
declare a list of variables and assign <code>@_</code> to them.  For example,
if we want to greet a particular group of people, we could do the
following:

<pre>use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   my($name1, $name2) = @_;
   return "Hello $name1 and $name2.\n" .
          "Where do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
print &amp;HowdyEveryone("bart", "lisa");
</pre>

<p>Note that since we used <code>my</code>, and we are in a new block, the
variables we declared will live only as long as the subroutine
execution.

<p>This subroutine leaves a bit to be desired.  It would be nice if we could
have a custom greeting, instead of just "Hello".  In addition, we would
like to greet as many people as we want to, not just two.  This version
fixes those two problems:
<pre>use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   my($greeting, @names) = @_;
   my $returnString;

   foreach my $name (@names) {
       $returnString .= "$greeting, $name!\n";
   }

   return $returnString .
          "Where do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
print &amp;HowdyEveryone("Howdy", "bart", "lisa", "homer", "marge", "maggie");
</pre>

<p>We use two interesting techniques in this example.  First of all, we use
a list as the last parameter when we accept the arguments.  This means
that everything after the first argument will be put into
<code>@names</code>.  Note that had any other variables followed
<code>@names</code>, they would have remained undefined.  However, scalars
before the array (like <code>$greeting</code>) do receive values out of
<code>@_</code>.  Thus, it is always a good idea to only make the array the
last argument.

<h1>Background of Perl</h1>

<p>In this appendix, we introduce a brief historical, sociological and
psychological reasons for why Perl works the way it does.  We also
include a brief history of Perl.

<p>When learning a new language, it is often helpful to learn the history,
motivations, and origins of that language.  In natural languages such as
English, this helps us understand the culture and heritage of the
language.  Such understanding leads to insight into the minds of those
who speak the language.  This newly found insight, obtained through
learning culture and heritage, assists us in learning the new language.

<p>This philosophy of language instruction can often be applied to
programming languages as well.  Although programming languages grow from
a logical or mathematical basis, they are rarely purely mathematical. 
Often, the people who design, implement and use the language influence
the language, based on their own backgrounds.  Because of the influence
the community has upon programming languages, it is useful, before
learning a programming language, to understand its history, motivations,
and culture.  To that end, this chapter examines the history, culture,
and heritage of the Perl language.

<h2>A Brief History of Perl</h2>

<p>Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, first posted Perl to the
<code>comp.sources</code> Usenet newsgroup in late 1987.  Larry had created
Perl as a text processing language for Unix-like operating systems. 
Before Perl, almost all text processing on Unix-like systems was done
with a conglomeration of tools that included AWK, <code>sed</code>, the
various shell programming languages, and C programs.  Larry wanted to
fill the void between "manipulexity" (the ability of languages like C
to "get into the innards of things") and "whipuptitude" (the
property of programming languages like AWK or <code>sh</code> that allows
programmers to quickly write useful programs).

<p>Thus, Perl, the Practical Extraction and Report Language <a rel=footnote href="pickingUpPerl.html#fn-12"><sup>12</sup></a>, was born.  Perl filled a
niche that no other tool before that date had.  For this reason, users
flocked to Perl.

<p>Over the next four years or so, Perl began to evolve.  By 1992, Perl
version 4 had become very stable and was a "standard" Unix programming
language.  However, Perl was beginning to show its limitations.  Various
aspects of the language were confusing at best, and problematic at
worst.  Perl worked well for writing small programs, but writing large
software applications in Perl was unwieldy.

<p>The designers of the Perl language, now a group, but still under Larry's
guidance, took a look around at the other languages that people were
using.  They seemed to ask themselves: "Why are people choosing other
languages over Perl?"  The outcome of this self-inspection was Perl,
version 5.

<p>The first release of version 5 came in late 1994.  Many believed that
version 5 made Perl "complete".  Gone were the impediments and much of
the confusion that were prevalent in version 4.  With version 5, Perl
was truly a viable, general purpose programming language and no longer
just a convenient tool for system administrators.

<h2>Perl as a Natural Language</h2>

<p>Natural languages, languages (such as English) that people use on a
daily basis to communicate with each other, are rich and complete.  Most
natural languages allow the speaker to express themselves succinctly and
clearly.  However, most natural languages are also full of arcane
constructs that carry over from the language's past.  In addition, for a
given natural language, it is impossible to fully master the vocabulary
and grammar because they are very large, extremely complex, and always
changing.

<p>You may wonder what these facts about natural languages have to do with
a programming language like Perl.  Surprising to most newcomers to Perl,
the parallels between Perl and a natural language like English are
striking.  Larry Wall, the father of Perl, has extensive scholastic
training as a linguist.  Larry applied his linguistic knowledge to the
creation of Perl, and thus, to the new student of Perl, a digression
into these language parallels will give the student insight into the
fundamentals of Perl.

<p>Natural languages have the magnificent ability to provide a clear
communication system for people of all skill levels and backgrounds. 
The same natural language can allow a linguistic neophyte (like a
three-year-old child) to communicate herself nearly completely to
others, while having only a minimal vocabulary.  The same language also
provides enough flexibility and clarity for the greatest of philosophers
to write their works.

<p>Perl is very much the same.  Small Perl programs are easy to write and
can perform many tasks easily.  Even the newest student of Perl can
write useful Perl programs.  However, Perl is a rich language with many
features.  This allows the creation of simple programs that use a
"limited" Perl vocabulary, and the creation of large, complicated
programs that seem to work magic.

<p>When studying Perl, it is helpful to keep the "richness" of Perl in
mind.  Newcomers find Perl frustrating because subtle changes in syntax
can produce deep changes in semantics.  It can even be helpful to think
of Perl as another natural language rather than another programming
language.  Like in a natural language, you should feel comfortable
writing Perl programs that use only the parts of Perl you know. 
However, you should be prepared to have a reference manual in hand when
you are reading code written by someone else.

<p>The fact that one cannot read someone else's code without a manual handy
and the general "natural language" nature of Perl have been frequently
criticized.  These arguments are well taken, and Perl's rich syntax and
semantics can be confusing to the newcomer.  However, once the initial
"information overload" subsides, most programmers find Perl exciting and
challenging.  Discovering new ways to get things done in Perl can be
both fun and challenging!  Hopefully, you will find this to be the case
as well.

<br>

<h2>The Slogans</h2>

<p>Clearly, Perl is a unique language.  This uniqueness has brought forth a
community and an ideology that is unprecedented with other languages.  One
does not have to be a member of this community or agree with this ideology
to use Perl, but it helps to at least understand the ideology to get the
most out of Perl.

<p>The common Perl slogans have become somewhat famous.  These slogans make
up the "Perl ethic"--the concepts that guide the way Perl itself is
built, and the way most Perl programs are written.

<p>"There's more than one way to do it".  This slogan, often abbreviated
<small>TMTOWTDI</small> (pronounced TIM-toady), is common among many
programmers, but Perl takes this idea to its logical conclusion.  Perl
is rich with non-orthogonality and shortcuts.  Most major syntactic
constructs in Perl have two or three exact equivalents.  This can be
confusing to newcomers, but if you try to embrace this diversity rather
than be frustrated by it, having "more than one way to do it" can be
fun.

<p>"The Swiss Army chain-saw".  This is the somewhat "less friendly"
summary of the previous term.  Sometimes, all these diverse, powerful
features of Perl make it appear that there are too many tools that are
too powerful to be useful all together on one "Swiss Army knife". 
However, eventually, most Perl users find all these different
"chain-saw"-style tools on one "Swiss Army" knife are a help rather
than a hindrance.

<p>"Perl makes easy jobs easy, and the hard jobs possible."  This is a
newer phrase in the Perl community, although it was originated by Alan
Kay decades ago, but it is quite valid.  Most easy tasks are very
straightforward in Perl.  As the saying goes, most programmers find that
there are very few jobs that Perl cannot handle well.  However, despite
what the saying might indicate, Perl is not a panacea; the programmer
should always choose the right tool for the job, and that right tool may
not always be Perl.

<p>"Perl promotes laziness, impatience and hubris."  These seem like strange
qualities to be promoting, but upon further analysis, it becomes clear why
they are important.

<p>Lazy programmers do not like to write the same code more than once. 
Thus, a lazy programmer is much more likely to write code to be reusable
and as applicable in as many situations as possible.

<p>Laziness fits well with impatience.  Impatient programmers do not like
to do things that they know very well the computer could do for them. 
Thus, impatient programmers (who are also lazy) will write programs to
do things that they do not want to have to do themselves.  This makes
these programs more usable for more tasks.

<p>Finally, laziness and impatience are insufficient without hubris.  If
programmers have hubris, they are much less likely to write unreadable
code.  A good bit of hubris is useful--it makes programmers want to
write code that they can show off to friends.  Thus, hubris, when
practiced in the conjunction with laziness and impatience, causes
programmers to write reusable, complete and readable code.  In other
words, it is possible to exploit these three "bad" traits to obtain a
"good" outcome.

<h1>GNU Free Documentation License</h1>

<p align="center">Version 1.1, March 2000</p>

<pre>Copyright &copy; 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

<ol type=1 start=0>
</p><li>PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

<p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

</p><li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

<p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

<p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

<p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

<p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

<p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<i>ascii</i> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
<small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> using a publicly available
<small>DTD</small>, and standard-conforming simple <small>HTML</small> designed
for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
<small>PDF</small>, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> for which
the <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated <small>HTML</small> produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

<p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

</p><li>VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

</p><li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

</p><li>MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

<ol type=A start=1>
</p><li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

<li>Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

<li>In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments
and/or dedications given therein.

<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

<li>Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

<li>Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
</ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

<p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

</p><li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgments",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

</p><li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

</p><li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. 
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

</p><li>TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

</p><li>TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

</p><li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
</ol>

<h2>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h2>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre>  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with the
  Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>.
  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre>

<p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<hr><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>Female pronouns are used throughout this book.  It can be
assumed that they refer to both genders.</p>

<li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>Actually, it cannot be longer than your computer has
virtual memory, but that is rarely a problem.</p>

<li><a name="fn-3"></a>
<p>C
programmers are already probably used to this idea.</p>

<li><a name="fn-4"></a>
<p>There are also standard packages available
to handle very large and very small numbers, and packages to force use of
integers only for all calculations.</p>

<li><a name="fn-5"></a>
<p>Language historians may notice that this is a
feature from the Ada language.</p>

<li><a name="fn-6"></a>
<p>The <code>'</code> character is a synonym for <code>::</code> which
is used for packages, a topic not covered in this text.</p>

<li><a name="fn-7"></a>
<p>Some operators are not associative at all (see <a href="pickingUpPerl.html#Summary%20of%20Scalar%20Operators">Summary of Scalar Operators</a>).</p>

<li><a name="fn-8"></a>
<p>It is possible to make
an array of arrays using a concept called "references", but that topic
is beyond the scope of this book.</p>

<li><a name="fn-9"></a>
<p>For another way to do this, see the exercises in this
section.</p>

<li><a name="fn-10"></a>
<p>Perl will eventually support
unicode, or some other extended character format, in which case it will
no longer merely be <small>ASCII</small> characters.</p>

<li><a name="fn-11"></a>
<p>Actually, Perl regular expressions have a
few additional features that go beyond the traditional, simple set of
regular expressions, but these are an advanced topic.</p>

<li><a name="fn-12"></a>
<p>Perl
has also been given the name, Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister. 
Choose the one with which you feel more comfortable.  Some even insist
that Perl is no longer an acronym for anything.  This argument has
merit, since Perl is never written PERL.</p>
