<H1><A NAME="SEC80" HREF="pickingUpPerl_toc.html#TOC80">Subroutines</A></H1>

<P>
Until now, all the Perl programs that we have written have  simply a set of
instructions, line by line.  Like any good language, Perl allows one to
write modular code.  To do this, at the very least, the language must allow
the programmer to set aside subroutines of code that can be reused.  Perl,
of course, provides this feature.


<P>
Note that many people call Perl subroutines "functions".  We prefer to
use the term "functions" for those routines that are built in to Perl,
and "subroutines" for code written by the Perl programmer.  This is
not standard terminology, so you may hear others use subroutines and
functions interchangeably, but that will not be the case in this book.
We feel that it is easier to make the distinction if we have two
different terms for functions and subroutines.


<P>
Note that user subroutines can be used anywhere it is valid to use a native
Perl function.




<H2><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="pickingUpPerl_toc.html#TOC81">Defining Subroutines</A></H2>

<P>
Defining a subroutine is quite easy.  You use the keyword <CODE>sub</CODE>,
followed by the name of your subroutine, followed by a code block.  This
friendly subroutine can be used to greet the user:



<PRE>
use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   print "Hello everyone.\nWhere do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
</PRE>

<P>
Now, anywhere in the code where we want to greet the user, we can simply
say:

<PRE>
&#38;HowdyEveryone;
</PRE>

<P>
and it will print that message to the user.  In fact, in most cases, the
<CODE>&#38;</CODE> for invoking subroutines is optional.




<H2><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="pickingUpPerl_toc.html#TOC82">Returning Values</A></H2>

<P>
Perhaps we did not want our new subroutine to actually print the
message.  Instead, we would like it to return the string of the message,
and then we will call <CODE>print</CODE> on it.


<P>
This is very easy to do with the <CODE>return</CODE> statement.



<PRE>
use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   return "Hello everyone.\nWhere do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
print &#38;HowdyEveryone;
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC83" HREF="pickingUpPerl_toc.html#TOC83">Using Arguments</A></H2>

<P>
A subroutine is not much good if you cannot give it input on which to
operate.  Of course, Perl allows you to pass arguments to subroutines just
like you would to native Perl functions.


<P>
At the start of each subroutine, Perl sets a special array variable,
<CODE>@_</CODE>, to be the list of arguments sent into the subroutine.  By
standard convention, you can  access these variables through
<CODE>$_[0 .. $#_]</CODE>.  However, it is a good idea to instead immediately
declare a list of variables and assign <CODE>@_</CODE> to them.  For example,
if we want to greet a particular group of people, we could do the
following:



<PRE>
use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   my($name1, $name2) = @_;
   return "Hello $name1 and $name2.\n" .
          "Where do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
print &#38;HowdyEveryone("bart", "lisa");
</PRE>

<P>
Note that since we used <CODE>my</CODE>, and we are in a new block, the
variables we declared will live only as long as the subroutine
execution.


<P>
This subroutine leaves a bit to be desired.  It would be nice if we could
have a custom greeting, instead of just "Hello".  In addition, we would
like to greet as many people as we want to, not just two.  This version
fixes those two problems:

<PRE>
use strict;
sub HowdyEveryone {
   my($greeting, @names) = @_;
   my $returnString;

   foreach my $name (@names) {
       $returnString .= "$greeting, $name!\n";
   }

   return $returnString .
          "Where do you want to go with Perl today?\n";
}
print &#38;HowdyEveryone("Howdy", "bart", "lisa", "homer", "marge", "maggie");
</PRE>

<P>
We use two interesting techniques in this example.  First of all, we use
a list as the last parameter when we accept the arguments.  This means
that everything after the first argument will be put into
<CODE>@names</CODE>.  Note that had any other variables followed
<CODE>@names</CODE>, they would have remained undefined.  However, scalars
before the array (like <CODE>$greeting</CODE>) do receive values out of
<CODE>@_</CODE>.  Thus, it is always a good idea to only make the array the
last argument.
